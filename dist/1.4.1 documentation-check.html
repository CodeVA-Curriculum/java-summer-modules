  <p>This quiz will prompt you to search for information in the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/">Processing Reference</a> materials, an external website that contains lots of information about how to use different methods available to you in the Processing environment.</p>
  <p>You should have the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/">Processing Reference</a> pulled up in a browser tab while you take this quiz so you can search for the answers on the site. Remember--no one remembers all this information; programmers (like you!) should always feel comfortable checking for information in documentation resources. It's not cheating; it's programming!</p>
