  <p>Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of a program that you created for the <em>Module 1 Mini-Project</em>.</p>
  <p>Then, in the same post, respond to the following reflective questions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Did anything surprise you as you wrote and tested code with the Processing environment?</li>
    <li>What challenges do you imagine a beginner student might have when they first start learning to code?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We'd love to use your work as an example in future trainings; please leave a note on this discussion board post if you are okay with us using your code, images of your program output, or the text of your reflections anonymously in future trainings.</p>
