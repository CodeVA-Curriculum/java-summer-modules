  <h2 style="margin-top:3rem;">Module 1 Mini-Project</h2>
  <p>In this mini-project, you'll modify the <em>Monochrome Tree Program</em> below to demonstrate your knowledge of calling methods, leaving comments in your code, and writing, testing, and debugging Java code written in the Processing environment.</p>
  <p><strong>Copy the program below into your Processing environment, and add some new features to the scene using simple shapes and text.</strong></p>
  <pre><code class="language-java">// Monochrome Tree Program
      
// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(250); // Draw a background 

// title
textSize(32);
fill(0); // set text color
text("Help the planet. Plant a tree!", 50, 50);
  
// tree
fill(75); // set shape color  
rect(310, 360, 20, 100);   
fill(200); 
circle(320, 350, 100);
</code></pre>
  <p>Here are some suggestions for what you might add:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use the <code>rect</code> method to add a field underneath the tree</li>
    <li>Use the <code>triangle</code> method several times to add some mountains to the background of the scene (for an extra challenge, use more <code>triangle</code>s to add snowcaps to the mountains)</li>
    <li>Add clouds to the sky above the tree</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Be sure to use comments to label the different parts of your code! Use the examples in the <em>Monochrome Tree Program</em> as a model.</p>
  <h3 style="margin-top:3rem;">Submission Instructions</h3>
  <p>When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A screenshot of your program's output</li>
    <li>Your code (just copy and paste it!)</li>
    <li>
      A reflection addressing the following questions:
      a. Did you engage in any debugging? Describe the problem and how you went about solving it, if applicable.
      b. What are the benefits and drawbacks to modifying code instead of starting your project with a blank editor?
      c. What skills, knowledge, and learning does your mini-project reveal, and what challenges, problems, or barriers does it conceal?
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 style="margin-top:3rem;">Rubric</h3>
  <p>Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:</p>
  <table style="border-collapse:collapse;border:1px solid;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style="border:1px solid;">Criteria</th>
        <th style="border:1px solid;">Advanced</th>
        <th style="border:1px solid;">Proficient</th>
        <th style="border:1px solid;">Developing</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="border:1px solid;">Methods</td>
        <td style="border:1px solid;">Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials</td>
        <td style="border:1px solid;">Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters</td>
        <td style="border:1px solid;">Your program makes use of a few methods, but it is unclear that you are comfortable using a variety of methods with different parameters in your programs</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="border:1px solid;">Comments</td>
        <td style="border:1px solid;">Your program uses lots of comments that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code</td>
        <td style="border:1px solid;">Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code, but not enough for someone to immediately understand the program without tracing it</td>
        <td style="border:1px solid;">Your program either does not include any comments, or the comments sometimes fail to accurately describe the code</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
