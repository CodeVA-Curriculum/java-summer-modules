Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of a program that includes the following:

* A `size` command to set the size of the application window
* At least two `ellipse` commands, to draw two ellipses in the window

You can just use the example code from the previous module, but feel free to get more creative if you want!

Then, respond to the following reflective questions:

1. Did anything surprise you as you wrote and tested code with the Processing environment?
2. What challenges do you imagine a beginner student might have when they first start learning to code?
