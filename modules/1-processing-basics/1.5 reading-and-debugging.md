# Reading & Debugging Code

By now, you've read a lot of code! When you click run and output appears immediately, it can be hard to remember how much work the computer does as it executes the code sequentially, one line at a time. It is a good idea to read code before running it to try and predict what the result of the code will be. Being able to read code is a really important skill; when you read a program, you should:

1. Imagine what each line of code causes the computer to do
2. Evaluate whether or not the code causes the computer to behave according to the programmer's expectations

When you process the code one line at a time, you may need to look back through the program or to look at the same code multiple times before you grasp how it works. By evaluating and predicting what a sequence of coded instructions will do, and comparing your prediction to the actual behavior of the computer, you'll build a *mental model* of how the computer behaves given a set of coded instructions. The more your mental model matches the behavior of the computer, the easier it will be for you to accurately predict the results of the code you write in the future. 

Reading code line-by-line to predict what the computer will do is called code tracing.

## Debugging

Sometimes, the computer will evaluate your code and do something you didn't expect. When that happens, you need to do some debugging. "Debugging" is when a programmer reads through their code and makes corrections to either the syntax (the "grammar" and spelling of their code) or the logic that they've employed in writing the program. Youâ€™ve likely done some debugging in your programs already!

### Syntax Errors

*Syntax errors* happen when the computer does not know how to interpret the instructions you've provided in your program. Usually, it means that you've misspelled something, forgotten to end a line with a semicolon, or made some other typographical error.

When you encounter a syntax error, read the text of the error in the *Console* area of the Processing environment. The error message will tell you the region of your code that's causing the problem, which should help you find your mistake.

The program below contains syntax errors; see if you can fix them! Copy the code into a new Processing sketch. Run it, read the error, and fix the code. Repeat this process until the program runs correctly.

```java
size(640, 480)
background(250);

noStroke()

// Add a label
fill(0)
textSize("32");
text(Here is a nice tree, 50, 50);

// Draw a tree
fill(75); // set shape color  
rect(310, 360, 20, 100);   
fill(200); 
circle(320, 350, 100);
```

### Logic Errors

*Logic errors* are errors that arise when your mental model of how the computer interprets the code doesn't match the actual behavior of the computer. A lot of times, code that contains logic errors will run just fine, but will produce strange or surprising results.

When you encounter a logic error, it's best to start simplifying your code to figure out what part of the program is behaving in an unexpected way. You can add `//` to the beginning of lines of code to remove them from the program without deleting them; this is called "commenting out" lines of code.

The program below contains a couple of logic errors; the program is supposed to display a tree on a hill, but the program only shows the hill.

:::code-example{src="64618194" alt="The output of the program above"}
```java
size(800, 600);

background(225);

// Draw the "branches"
circle(400, 300, 100);

// Draw the tree trunk
rect(390, 300, 20, 100);

// Draw the hill
ellipse(400, 500, 1200, 600);
```
:::

Copy the code into a new Processing sketch and run it. Trace the code, and make changes so it produces the following output:

What might the programmer be misunderstanding about the way the computer reads the code based on their mistake?

### Code-Writing Strategies

You will encounter lots of problems, errors, and unexpected results when you write code. Nobody can sit down and write an entire program without errors! Instead, people often write programs little by little, testing frequently as they go. Here are some strategies for writing code that will help you handle errors when they pop up:

1. **Always start with working code:** Start your program with a simple set of instructions that you know will work (it is common practice to use an existing program that works rather than writing all the code from scratch). Then, as you add code (and problems!) you will know that your program worked in the past, and you can return to that version if you run into something mysterious.
2. **Test frequently:** When you add new lines of code to a program, they might contain errors! Make sure you test very frequently as you code. That way, you can catch errors as you write them instead of trying to fix all your errors at the end.
3. **Experiment!** Don't be afraid to try something new! You won't break the computer; the worst thing that can happen is the computer produces an error.
4. **When in Doubt, Undo:** If you encounter a persistent bug in your code that you just can't seem to figure out, revert your code back to when it was working (Ctrl+Z is your friend!), and try again. If you were testing frequently, the working code shouldn't be all that different from your broken code.
