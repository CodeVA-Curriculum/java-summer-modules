# Module 1 Mini-Project Discussion

Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of a program that includes the following:

* A `size` command to set the size of the application window
* At least two `ellipse` commands, to draw two ellipses in the window

Then, in the same post, respond to the following reflective questions:

1. Did anything surprise you as you wrote and tested code with the Processing environment?
2. What challenges do you imagine a beginner student might have when they first start learning to code?

We'd love to use your work as an example in future trainings; please leave a note on this discussion board post if you are okay with us using your code, images of your program output, or the text of your reflections anonymously in future trainings.
