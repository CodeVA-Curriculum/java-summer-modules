# Module 1 Mini-Project Discussion

Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of a program that you created for the *Module 1 Mini-Project*.

Then, in the same post, respond to the following reflective questions:

1. Did anything surprise you as you wrote and tested code with the Processing environment?
2. What challenges do you imagine a beginner student might have when they first start learning to code?
3. Did you engage in any debugging? Describe the problem and how you went about solving it, if applicable. 
4. What are the benefits and drawbacks to modifying code instead of starting your project with a blank editor? 
5. What skills, knowledge, and learning does your mini-project express about your coding experience, and what challenges, problems, or barriers does it conceal? Or, what skills and knowledge did you show in your project, and what challenges did you experience creating it?

We'd love to use your work as an example for future participants; please leave a note on this discussion board post if you are okay with us using your code, images of your program output, or the text of your reflections anonymously in future training sessions.
