# Module 1 Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the CodeVA Programming with Java professional learning course! In this first module, you'll explore the basics of coding using the Processing framework, a Java environment focusing on creating interactive art with code. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Read, write, test, and debug simple Processing programs
* Navigate the Processing interface to save and load files
* Build visual art using Java by calling methods with parameters
* Use the Processing reference materials to learn more about a method and how to implement it

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| source code | Instructions written in a coding language to control the behavior of a computer |
| comment | A section of source code that the computer will ignore, often used to leave explanatory notes about source code |
| method | A command for a computer to execute |
| argument/parameter | Information passed as input to a method |
| debugging | The process of editing code causing unexpected behavior on the part of the computer |
| syntax error | A mistake in source code that causes the computer to be unable to interpret the instructions |
| logic error | A mistake in source code that causes the computer to behave in an unexpected or unintended way |
| GUI | Stands for graphical user interface; a term for the appearance and behavior of a computer program running outside of the command line environment |
| code tracing | The process of reading a program line-by-line to predict what the program will cause the computer to do |
| mental model | A set of assumptions about how the computer works, and how the computer will behave as it interprets a set of coded instructions |
| code tracing | The practice of reading a set of coded instructions line-by-line to try and predict how the computer will behave when it executes the program |
