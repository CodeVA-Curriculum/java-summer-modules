  <p style="p{color:red;font-size:14px;}">Then, respond to the following reflective questions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Did anything surprise you as you wrote and tested code with the Processing environment?</li>
    <li>What challenges do you imagine a beginner student might have when they first start learning to code?</li>
  </ol>
