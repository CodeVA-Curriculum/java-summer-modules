# Share Something New!

Now that you've explored the [Processing reference materials](https://processing.org/reference/), try making some changes to the *Monochrome Tree Program* below:

:::code-example{src="64618195" alt="A greyscale tree with a title that says Help the planet, plant a tree!"}
```java
// Monochrome Tree Program
      
// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(250); // Draw a background 

// title
textSize(32);
fill(0); // set text color
text("Help the planet. Plant a tree!", 50, 50);
  
// tree
fill(75); // set shape color  
rect(310, 360, 20, 100);   
fill(200); 
circle(320, 350, 100);

// message
print("This is my first program");
```
:::

Here are some suggestions:

* Change some of the parameters to make something in the scene larger or smaller than it was before
* Add a new shape to the scene
* Look up a new [shape](https://processing.org/reference/#shape) or [typography](https://processing.org/reference/#typography) element and add it to the scene
* Complete one of the *Modify* coding challenges from the *Using the Processing Reference* page

Once you've made changes to the program above, create a post on this discussion board that includes the following:

1. A screenshot of the output of your program
2. A sentence describing what you modified and its effect on the scene
3. A reflection on the following question: "What are the benefits of giving students examples to modify when they are learning to code, and what are the possible downsides?"
