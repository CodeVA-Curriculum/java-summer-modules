# "Re-Bugging" Code

You know what's a lot easier than finding and removing bugs from broken code? Adding *new* bugs to *working* code!

The program below works perfectly (it's probably familiar--it's the *Monochrome Tree Program* from before):

```java
// Monochrome Tree Program
      
// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(250); // Draw a background 

// title
textSize(32);
fill(0); // set text color
text("Help the planet. Plant a tree!", 50, 50);
  
// tree
fill(75); // set shape color  
rect(310, 360, 20, 100);   
fill(200); 
circle(320, 350, 100);

// message
print("This is my first program");
```

**Copy this code into the Processing environment, and add some logic or syntax errors**. Then, post your broken code on this discussion board along with the number of errors you've added.

Then, pick another person's post and try to debug their broken version of the *Monochrome Tree Program!*. Feel free to ask for hints in the comments.
