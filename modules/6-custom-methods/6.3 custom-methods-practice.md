# Custom Methods Practice

In this section, you'll read, debug, and write some code that uses custom methods as a way of practicing the basics and encountering some of the tricky problems associated with custom methods in a supported way. Below, you'll find three sections--"I Do", where you read and analyze some custom method implementations; "We Do", where you'll build on the code by adding another custom method definition; and "You Do", where you'll design and implement your own custom method from scratch. By the time you're finished with this section, you'll have a pretty solid understanding of how to implement custom methods, some of the common mistakes or issues beginners might run into, and how to write the code in your programs so everything works as expected.

## "I Do"

Check out the program below:

:::code-example{src="TODO:"}
```java
TODO:
```
:::

The `setup()` method draws a background and a procedurally-generated cloud (much like the last example). I'm going to use a custom method to organize the "cloud-drawing" code into one area, and then add some extra features.

### Implementing a Method

First, I'll create a method definition using the name `drawCloud()` at the bottom of my program:

```java TODO:
void setup() {
    size(800,600);
    noStroke();
}

void draw() {

}

void drawCloud() {
    // cloud code goes here
}
```

Then, I'll move all the relevant "cloud" code from `setup()` into the `drawCloud()` method definition:

:::code-example{src="TODO:"}
```java
TODO:
```
:::

You can see in the screenshot above that the program no longer displays the cloud! Beginners sometimes get discouraged at this stage, thinking that they have made some kind of mistake. That's not the case, though; the method definition is perfect, but the code doesn't contain any instructions for the computer to actually *run* the `drawCloud()` method. To finish the method-implementation process, I need to add a method *call* to the `setup()` method:

:::code-example{src="TODO:"}
```java
TODO:
```
:::

Now the program output is back to the way it was, but the "cloud" code is organized into a method!

### Adding a Feature

Next, I'll change how the cloud method works slightly to create more interesting-looking clouds. Instead of using the `random()` method to choose a random `x` and `y` position for the circles which make up the cloud, I'll have the program "scan" over the `y` axis and draw circles in layers starting from the bottom of the cloud area and working its way up. As it scans, I'll have the color of the cloud get lighter and lighter, creating a "shadow" at the bottom of the cloud.

Since I've organized the "cloud" code into a method, all my work will take place there; the rest of the program won't change. First, I'll edit the `drawCloud()` method so the "cloud" is a stack of four circles in a random position on the screen:

:::code-example{src="TODO:"}
```java
void drawCloud() {
    float x = random(200, 600);
    float y = random(200, 400);
    float count = 5;
    while(count > 0) {
        circle(x, (count*10)+y, 25);
        count = count - 1;
    }
}
```
:::

Then, I'll add the color-change feature, where the circle `fill()` color starts as a dark grey, and gets lighter as `count` decreases:

:::code-example{src="TODO:"}
```java
void drawCloud() {
    float x = random(200, 600);
    float y = random(200, 400);
    float count = 5;
    while(count > 0) {
        fill(255-(10*count)); // calculate the greyscale color based on count
        circle(x, (count*10)+y, 25);
        count = count - 1; // count down to end loop
    }
}
```
:::

Finally, I'll add another loop to the `drawCloud()` method and tweak the coordinates so each layer of the cloud stack contains five `circle()` shapes instead of just one:

:::code-example{src="TODO:"}
```java
void drawCloud() {
    float x = random(200, 600);
    float y = random(200, 400);
    float count = 5;
    while(count > 0) {
        fill(255-(10*count));
        // draw a bunch of circles for each layer
        int circCount = 1;
        while(circCount < 6) {
          float cx = random(x-50, x+50); // random x coord
          float cy = random(0, 5); // a little randomness to the y
          float cr = random(0, 10); // a little randomness to the radius
          circle(cx, (count*10)+y+cy, 60+cr);
          circCount = circCount + 1;
        }
        count = count - 1;
    }
}
```
:::

It's not perfect, and the method could definitely use some tweaking, but it's a nice effect! The best part about it is that all my work took place in the method using "local" variables (x, y, count, circCount, cx, cy, cr), which means the rest of the program won't be affected by any mistakes I make while I'm making the method! 
## "We Do"

Next, let's add a mountain range and a field to the scene. The mountains should be triangles with a white, triangular snowcap. We already know that we probably want to draw the mountains *after* the clouds (just in case they overlap), so let's add the method call to the program:

```java
TODO:
```

This addition breaks the code; you can't call a method that doesn't have a definition! Go ahead and add one to the bottom of the program above, using the syntax of `drawClouds()` as a model. Once you've succeeded, you should be able to run your program (but you still won't see mountains because the method definition is blank). Click the button below to reveal the completed version if you'd like:

:::collapse{title="Reveal Example"}
```java
TODO:
```
:::

Finally, add some code to draw triangular mountains. You can make them as fancy or as simple as you like. Click the button below to reveal one possible solution:

:::collapse{title="Reveal Example"}
:::code-example{src="TODO:"}
```java
TODO:
```
:::

And that's it! Another method added to the program.

## "You Do"

Finally, add a method that displays a cluster of tiny buildings at the base of the mountain range (like a city with skyscrapers, for example). Your `setup()` method will look something like this:

```java
void setup() {
    size(800,600);
    noStroke();
    int count = 0;
    while(count < 7) {
        drawCloud();
        count = count + 1;
    }
    mountains();
    city(); // call your new method
}
```

Be sure to follow the steps for creating a custom method definition demonstrated in this section and the previous one!
