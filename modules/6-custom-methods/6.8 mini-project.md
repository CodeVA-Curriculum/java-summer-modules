# Module 7 Mini-Project

In this mini-project, you'll use custom methods to organize a starter program into functional components. Creating your own methods makes your code more readable, and allows you to think about your program in terms of its component parts. Expressing these parts as methods is a core competency for Java programmers.

Here's the starting point:

```java
int sky = color(157,227,250);
int grass = color(46, 179, 93);
int trunk = color(92, 81, 59);
int cloud = color(255, 255, 255);

void setup() {
  size(800, 600);
  background(sky);
  noStroke();
  
  //draw the ground
  fill(grass);
  rect(0, 300, 800, 300);

  int i=0;
  while(i<20) {
    i=i+1;
    float dice=random(0,6);
    if(dice<4) {
        // Draw a tree
        float x=random(0, 800);
        float y=random(300, 600);
        float r=random(10, 50);
        float trunkSize=r/10*3;
        stroke(0);
        fill(trunk);
        rect(-trunkSize/2+x, r/10+y, trunkSize, r*2);
        fill(grass);
        ellipse(x, y, r*2.5, r*2.5);
    } else {
        // Draw a cloud
        float x=random(0, 800);
        float y = random(0, 300);
        float ry=random(20, 50);
        float rx=random(50, 100);
        fill(cloud);
        ellipse(x, y, rx, ry);
    }
  }
}
```

The program above includes code to draw a tree, and code to draw a cloud. I've labeled the relevant pieces with comments. The code *below* is what you should start with. It includes a call to a `tree()` method which has no definition, so the program won't run properly as it stands right now.

**Copy the code into your Processing environment, and 1) add a definition for the `tree()` method that displays a randomly-sized tree in a random location, and 2) defines and calls a `cloud()` method to replace the relevant code in `setup()`.**

```java
int sky = color(157,227,250);
int grass = color(46, 179, 93);
int trunk = color(92, 81, 59);
int cloud = color(255, 255, 255);

void setup() {
  size(800, 600);
  background(sky);
  noStroke();
  
  //draw the ground
  fill(grass);
  rect(0, 300, 800, 300);

  int i=0;
  while(i<20) {
    i=i+1;
    float dice=random(0,6);
    if(dice<4) {
        tree(); // Draw a tree
    } else {
        // Draw a cloud
        float x=random(0, 800);
        float y = random(0, 300);
        float ry=random(20, 50);
        float rx=random(50, 100);
        fill(cloud);
        ellipse(x, y, rx, ry);
    }
  }
}

```

Once you've refactored the code to define and call a `tree()` method and a `cloud()` method, consider adding one of the following features:

* Create a "sun" in your picture at a random location, and set the color of the "sky" based on how low the sun is.
* Create a "bird" method and add a loop that displays flocks of birds in random locations around your scene. If the bird happens to be "on the ground", be sure to draw them that way! Likewise, if they are in the air, make sure they look like they are flying.
* Create a method that displays a house, and display an indeterminate number of homes in your scene.
* Edit the `cloud()` method you created to make the clouds a random cluster of circles or ellipses rather than just one ellipse.

Be sure to use comments and descriptive variable names to help label the different parts of your program!

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

| Criteria  | Goal | Stretch Goal |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Methods   | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials |
| Custom Methods | Your program makes use of one or more custom methods to display composite figures (i.e., visual elements made up of more than one primitive shape) | Your program makes use of several custom methods, each with a particularly elegant functional component purpose in the design of your program |
| Expressiveness | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it | Your program uses comments and variable names that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code |
