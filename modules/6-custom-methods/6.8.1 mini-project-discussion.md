# Module 6 Mini-Project Gallery & Discussion

Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of the output of the program that you created for the *Module 6 Mini-Project* (just the visual you created, don't worry about including code in your screenshot).

Then, in the same post, pick **two** of the reflective questions below to respond to:

1. Custom methods are a powerful organizational tool, but they can be pretty confusing. What aspects of creating and using custom methods did you find most difficult?
2. What challenges do you imagine students might encounter as they work with custom methods for the first time?
3. Is reading code that makes use of custom methods more difficult, or easier than reading code that does not use them? Explain your answer.

We'd love to use your work as an example in future trainings; please leave a note on this discussion board post if you are okay with us using your code, images of your program output, or the text of your reflections anonymously in future trainings.
