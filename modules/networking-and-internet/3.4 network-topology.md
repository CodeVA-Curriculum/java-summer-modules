# Networks

A **network** is a collection of connected computing devices that can communicate with one another. Networks are all around us all the time--your smartphone is connected to a network via WiFi or via cellular data, your school computer is connected to a school network of all the other computers in the building, and your home internet is connected to a huge network that belongs to your Internet service provider (ISP). Computing networks are often connected to the internet, but they don't have to be; they can just be small networks of two or more computers that only communicate with one another. This section is all about how networks work, what devices make them up, and how you interact with networks every day to complete simple computing tasks.

## Network Principles

The computing devices in a network have *roles* depending on their relationship to the other computing devices in the network and what they are doing. Here are the different roles of devices in a network, and what they do:

* **Servers** are computers that provide information to other devices in the network. They store things like pictures, videos, websites, and other kinds of data for other computers in the network to access.
* **Clients** are computers that request data from servers. When you type a web address into a web browser to access a website, your computer is a **client** requesting data from a **server** computer somewhere else in the world. Most of the time, when you use a computer, that computer is a **client** on your network.
* **Routers** are special, purpose-built computers that manage traffic between clients and servers. The internet is made up of many thousands of routers connected together, passing data from clients to servers and back again like a relay race. Your home network might only have one router that connects all of your personal devices together via your WiFi.

## Network Topology

Network topology is a term that refers to the layout of the different pieces of hardware that make up an internet network. When you connect a device to wireless internet, you are connecting your device to a vast network of cables and devices that send your data all around the world. Most of the internet is not actually wireless; while wireless internet is good for short distance communication, physical wires are much faster and more durable. The layout of physical wires connecting different devices is what makes up the infrastructure of the internet.

The infrastructure of the internet is divided up into different smaller networks. The smallest of these is called a **local area network**. The network of laptops, phones, smart TVs, and other devices all connected to your router in your home or school form a local area network, or **LAN**. Lots of local area networks are connected over wireless routers, and usually are contained to a relatively small geographical area like a single building or home.

A larger network, like an office building or a school, might be made up of several LANs connected via a device called a **switch**. A switch that connects several LANs forms a larger network called a **wide area network**, or **WAN**. Your school district network might be a wide area network, with each classroom being a local area network with its own wireless access point or wired router, but WANs can also be very, very large--they can span entire regions or countries.

If you only need to use a network to access other devices connected to it, you can stop there. However, if you want to access the Web, your LAN or WAN needs a connection to an **internet service provider**, or **ISP**. ISPs maintain the cables and connections that connect your home LAN or WAN to the Web.

Because internet services providers are businesses  and not utilities (like electricity and water), they are not required to provide equal access to the internet for everyone. Additionally, they are not required to charge everyone the same price for internet access. Across the country, people have unequal access to the internet and the opportunities it provides. Online education, job training, employment opportunities, and communities based online are all inaccessible to many people who do not have access to fast and reliable internet. Furthermore, many areas have only one internet service provider, which means that users who are dissatisfied with the quality of their internet services cannot find a new provider. These factors create what many people call a “digital divide”, where some communities have access to digital tools and services while others do not, leading to unequal opportunities and access to resources.

### Local, Network, and Cloud Locations

The data that you can access via your network can be in a lot of different places, and each of these places has a name and different pros and cons for storing data there. Here are some explanations:

* **Local** storage refers to data stored on your personal device. If your device needs to access data stored on its own hard drive, we can say it's accessing *local* data.
* **Network** storage refers to data stored on devices in your local area network or your wide area network. This is data that is not on your personal device, but is located on a device perhaps somewhere else in your home or school. You do *not* need to access the internet to get data from network storage; it's accessible via your smaller network, and the data never has to leave your home to travel between the devices on your home network.
* **Cloud** storage refers to data stored on someone else's computer in a different place *outside* of your LAN or WAN. Some examples include Google Drive, Dropbox, or other online file storage services. In this situation, you *rent* space on someone else's computer, and you can access your data stored in that rented space via the internet. You can sort of think about this relationship like renting a storage unit--you can put your belongings in the unit, but you do not own the property or the unit itself. In the same way, you can upload your data to Google's servers, and download it back to your device later, but you don't actually have physical access to the computer where that data is stored.

Local and network storage are very private--the only people who have access to it are people who have access to your computer or network. Unfortunately, these storage locations may be less secure than cloud storage if you aren't comfortable setting up your own network security. Cloud storage might be safer because the company who owns the computer might be better at securing their network. However, it's important to be sure you trust the cloud provider with your data, because you won't be able to do anything if they accidentally lose it or someone gets access to their servers.

### Backing Up Your Data

Most people recommend that you try to back up, or save, your digital files in at least three locations--locally on your device (you already do this by default), on a separate network storage location (like an external hard drive), and in a cloud storage location (like Dropbox or Google Drive) to avoid losing your data. That way, if one of the three gets deleted or lost, you have to other back ups to restore your data.

## Bandwidth, Load, & Latency

Network speed has a few different factors which determine how much data you can send over a given network. There are a lot of factors that can affect network speed, including the kind of access point you use, the number of devices on your network, the physical components of the network connections, or the speed your internet service provider allows you to have.

**Bandwidth** is a measurement of (theoretically) how much data you can send in a given period of time over the network. You can measure bandwidth in "bits per second" (b/s), or if there's more bandwidth you can use "kilobytes per second" (Kb/s), "megabytes per second" (Mb/s), or "gigabytes per second" (Gb/s). Most of the time, your normal internet connection is measured in kilobytes (for pretty slow internet) or megabytes (for pretty fast internet). If you have fiber-optic internet, you might have 1 or 2 Gb/s upload and download bandwidth.

**Load** is a measurement of how much data a given computer or network is processing at a given time (measured in b/s, Mb/s, or Gb/s). If your network load exceeds your network's bandwidth, you'll notice higher latency and reduced speed as you try to complete tasks that require the network (e.g., file transfer, accessing network storage, connecting to the internet).

**Latency** is a measurement of how long it takes for one bit to move from one destintation to another. We usually measure latency in milliseconds. In your home network, you probably don't notice any latency (i.e., it's less than 10 milliseconds). If you need to communicate over a larger distance or over the internet, you probably experience noticable latency (i.e., between 10 and 100 milliseconds) depending on how far the person you're trying to communicate is from you. Normally, latency doesn't matter. However, latency is the reason it's difficult to play music together or do other similar, time-sensitive collaborative tasks over an internet connection. You can reduce latency by reducing the length of network cables, or by upgrading copper electrical cables to fiber-optic cables.
