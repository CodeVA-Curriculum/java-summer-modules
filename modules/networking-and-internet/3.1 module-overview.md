# Introduction to Networking & the Internet

We use computers for all sorts of things, from doing simple computation to complex data analysis to profound creative expression. To accomplish these sorts of tasks, we rely **networks**, connected groups of computers communicating with one another and working together. Networks allow us to use computing devices to communicate almost instantly over vast distances, use combinations of computers to accomplish tasks that would be difficult or impossible with only one device, and to embed wirelessly connected computing devices all around us.

This module is all about computing devices and how they communicate over networks. We will also cover the **internet**, a very large and complex network that allows us to communicate with others using computing devices.

> The videos in this pre-work module are from [Code.org](https://code.org/), a nonprofit computer science curriculum and professional development provider. Specifically, these videos are part of their [AP Computer Science Principles](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2021) curriculum.

## Learning Objectives & Praxis Alignment

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Understand and apply knowledge of networks, including security issues and the Web (V.B.1-3, 6)
* Define & explain the five pillars of cybersecurity: confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, and authentication (V.B.5)
* Describe the role of operating systems in coordinating the hardware and software components of computing devices (V.A.1)
* Understand and apply knowledge of operating systems, computing systems, communication between devices, & cloud computing (V.A)
* Compare & contrast network types, including wireless and wired communication systems (V.A.7)
* Describe digital and physical strategies for maintaining security (V.B.4)
* Describe embedded computing devices & applications (V.A.2)
* Describe tradeoffs between local, network, and cloud computing & storage (V.A.6)

## Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| bandwidth | The total maximum transfer rate of a network cable or device. |
| latency | The time required for a computer on a network to respond to a request. The lower the number, the faster the response. |
| load | The total required bandwidth at a given moment in time |
| topology | The physical configuration of a network that determines how the network's computers are connected |
| wireless access point (WAP) | A wireless receiver for connecting wirelessly to a network or the Internet |
| local area network (LAN) | Networking equipment or computers in close proximity to each other, capable of communicating, sharing resources and information |
| wide area network (WAN) | A collection of computers and devices connected by a communications network over a wide geographic area |
| internet service provider (ISP) | A company that provides Internet access to users or subscribers of its service |
| IP address | A number identifying of a computer or another device on the Internet. It is similar to a mailing address, which identifies where postal mail comes from and where it should be delivered |
| IPv4 | Short for Internet Protocol version 4, IPv4 is a network protocol defined in RFC 791 that is the primary Internet and Ethernet network transmission. Because IPv4 is only able to support 4,294,967,296 possible IP addresses and technical limitations, new software is slowly making the transition to IPv6; the next version of IP |
| IPv6 | Short for Internet Protocol version 6. It is a network protocol for Internet and Ethernet network transmission, first introduced in 1996. IPv6 includes improvements over IPv4 such as a wider range of Internet addresses, improved routing and autoconfiguration, embedded encryption, and more |
| domain name system (DNS) | Short for Domain Name System, a DNS is a service that receives a request containing a domain name hostname and responds with the corresponding IP address |
| packet | A term first coined by Donald Davies in 1965 that describes a segment of data sent from one computer or device to another over a network. You can think of it as a package filled with data being delivered to another area |
| reliability | When used to describe networks, refers to the likelihood that a packet will reach its destination |
| redundancy | When used to describe networks, refers to the number of paths available for packet transmission. Redundant networks are **fault tolerant** |
| hardware | Any physical component of a computer system containing a circuit board, ICs, or other electronics |
| software | A collection of instructions that enable the user to interact with a computer, its hardware, or perform tasks |
| URL | A standardized naming convention for addressing documents accessible over the Internet |
| client | A computer that connects to and uses the resources of a remote computer, or server |
| server | A software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network |
| HTTP, HTTPS | Short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP is a set of standards that allow users of the World Wide Web to exchange information found on web pages. HTTPS is used to protect transmitted data from eavesdropping |
| request | A message from a client computer to a server computer requesting a transmission of data, often used to load a webpage from a server |
| HTML | Short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web |
| IPOS | An acronym that stands for Input, Processing, Output, Storage; a model that defines a computing devices as having all four of these attributes |

## Prerequisite Information

We recommend completing the *Binary, Encoding, & Encryption* module before beginning work on the *Networking & the Internet* module.

You should also plan to complete the "Pre-Work" section of this module before the synchronous session on **June 18th**.
