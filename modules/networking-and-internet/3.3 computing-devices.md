# What Is a Computing Device?

What are the different parts of an iPhone? People give commands to iPhones by pressing on a touchscreen or by speaking. The iPhone processes the command, and gives results back by displaying information or videos on the screen or playing sound. There is specific hardware inside an iPhone to process these kinds of commands. An iPhone can also store information that is important to its user, such as music, contacts, and text messages. The hardware that allows the iPhone to store this information has to balance being portable while also being capable of storing enough information.

You probably saw a bunch of different computing devices all around you. If you had to give someone instructions for identifying computers (especially someone who has never seen a computer before), what would you give them? What is the difference between something that is and isn’t a computer? Computer scientists think about this question all the time. It’s hard to study something if you can’t define what that thing is!

If you had to give a definition of a computer, you might say that a computer is a machine that takes input from the outside world, processes that input and stores data, and then gives some sort of output back to the outside world. This definition of a computing device is called the **IPOS model** (input, processing, output, storage).

Computers are machines capable of being programmed to accept data (called input), perform some action or process based on the input to produce usable information (called output). The output can be stored for safekeeping or later use. Software directs the processing of the input to output. Storage can refer to permanent secondary storage (e.g., flash drive, hard disk) or temporary storage (e.g., RAM). The computer can access data in storage and use it as input for further processing, or display it as output.

## Hardware Components

**Hardware** refers to the physical components of a computing device. Different devices have different kinds of hardware; here are some examples:

* **ROM (read-only memory):** A small circuit board storing a permanent set of data. The computer reads this data as it boots up, and relies on it to correctly "set itself up" when it powers on. The computer never changes ROM data; it is built in by the manufacturer and if it gets corrupted your computer will likely not even turn on
* **RAM (random access memory):** RAM is the temporary storage on your computer. It is what holds the data associated with programs currently running on your computer. If you have lots of RAM, you can run lots of simultaneous programs. If the programs in RAM storage start to run out of space, your computer will start to slow down.
* **Hard Drive:** The hard drive is the *persistent* storage of your computer. Even if you power your computer down, the data on the hard drive will remain there. The computer can *read* and *write* to the hard drive; this is where the binary information associated with your files, images, software programs, videos and other data is stored
* **GPU (graphics processing unit):** The GPU is a special hardware component that is responsible for rendering image data and sending it to your display. GPUs do *parallel processing*, which means they can execute many sets of instructions simultaneously.
* **CPU (computational processing unit):** The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, which is responsible for the "processing" stage of the IPOS model. It is a powerful microchip containing many transistors. It "fetches" data from RAM, including instructions written in code, decodes the information, and "executes" those instructions. This "fetch, decode, execute" cycle is the fundamental operation of a computing device
* **Motherboard:** The circuit board that houses all of the above components, providing them with power and mediating connections between relevant components

There are lots of other kinds of hardware components for computing devices, including input devices (e.g., mouse, touchscreen, microphone) and output devices (e.g., speakers, monitors). Anything you can touch with your hand is hardware!

## Software Components

**Software** is the set of instructions a computing device follows to complete computational tasks. You can't touch software--it exists physically as voltages stored in arrays of transistors. When you use a computer, you interact with the output *produced* by software, not with software itself.

One important software component in computing is an **operating system**, a structured, organized piece of software that coordinates the actions of the computer. A computer's operating system is responsible for managing all of the hardware components that make up the computing device, and is also responsible for interpreting and running all the *other* kinds of softwares that a computer might need to run. "Windows", "Mac OS", "iOS", "Android", and "Linux" are all different types of operating systems. Operating systems are a complex topic with a lot to learn, but the main idea is that an operating system is responsible for interpreting the data in storage or coming into a computer via input, send that data to the right place, and then use data from other software applications as input to direct hardware components to do something. One useful metaphor is to think of an operating system as a conductor or manager of other smaller pieces of software running on the machine.

## Embedded Computing Devices

Not all computing devices look like a personal computer tower or a laptop--lots of computers are very small, or embedded in places you might not expect. A car has a computer in it, which often is responsible for managing cruise control, displaying data on the instrument panel, or even doing more complex tasks like routing directions using GPS data. In recent years, manufacturers have been embedding computers in all sorts of places and connecting them to the internet to provide different kinds of services to users. These "embedded" computing devices don't look much like typical computers, but they still meet our IPOS definition--they take input, store data, process that data with a CPU, and output information to users or to other computing devices.

Some examples of "embedded" computing include internet-connected appliances, "smart speakers" that search the internet and provide information based on voice commands, or "smart home" devices that automate lights, thermostat settings, home security, or other similar tasks. These embedded devices sometimes connect to the internet; the name for these embedded, internet-connected systems is "the Internet of Things", or **"IoT"**. These kinds of devices often use non-typical sensors to gather input (like temperature sensors, motion sensors, etc.) and provide output over the internet, where the data is stored on another computer far away. Then, you can connect to that computer using a mobile application or something similar to view data.

## Sample Lessons

The components of computing devices is important content in lots of computer science curricula. Check out the items below to see some ways of teaching about computing devices to middle and high school students!

* The book *[Critically Conscious Computing](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/)* has a chapter about [computing devices](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/computers) and chapter about [operating systems](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/operating). If you are interested in learning more about these topics, we *highly* recommend you check them out!
* The *[Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/curriculum)* curriculum has a unit about computing devices, with lots of excellent lesson plan ideas embedded in it.
<!-- * This [CodeVA lesson plan](TODO:) is an unplugged exploration of computing hardware where learners use papercraft to build a computing device. -->
* Code.org's [AP Computer Science Principles](https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2021) and [Computer Science Discoveries](https://studio.code.org/courses/csd-2021) curricula each have units devoted to this topic for different grade levels and levels of rigor.
