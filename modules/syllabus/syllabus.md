# Programming Using Java Syllabus

This three-day course will introduce educators to the basics of programming using Java in the Processing development environment, a graphical application framework focused on creative coding & visual art. This course covers programming concepts including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, methods, and the basics of object-oriented programming. The course also introduces pedagogical strategies to help learners write code expressively, engage in inductive learning, and provide scaffolding for novice students just beginning to code using a text-based, strongly-typed programming languaage.  Throughout the course, participants will learn through partaking in a variety of projects and collaborate with other educators to develop instructional techniques and curriculum for their students in their unique professional contexts. No prior coding experience is required for this course!

Participants may include: 9-12th grade computer science, career & technical education, or math teachers, instructional technology staff, CS or educational technology specialists (LMS, Gifted, SPED, ELL, STEM, etc.), school or district-level curriculum writers, or other instructional leaders at the building or district level.

**Pathways & Prerequisites:** This course has no prerequisites. This course was created to help educators are beginners with programming in a text-based language, have an interest in computer science, and/or want to have fun learning how to integrate coding into their instructional practices.

**Course Materials:** In order to participate in this course, participants must have access to 1) a computer on which they have permission to install the Processing IDE prior to the summer sessions, and 2) persistent and reliable internet access during the 3-day synchronous sessions.

## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

* Read, write, test, and debug programs written in the Java Processing framework
* Read, write, test, and debug Java programs that include variables, conditionals, loops, and custom classes & methods.
* Explain & teach fundamental attributes of object-oriented & strongly-typed coding languages
* Identify & practice pedagogical techniques for engaging students in creative coding, including using unplugged activities, the Use-Modify-Create model, and student-led project-based learning

## Essential Questions

In addition to the course learning objectives above, participants will engage the following essential questions as they learn to code with Java:

* What is Java, and what is Processing?
* How might I introduce new programming skills to students to build their capacity as creators?
* What are some projects students might engage with to practice their coding skills?
* What are some pedagogical techniques I can use to improve student learning outcomes?

## Course Agenda

This professional learning course is comprised of a set of online learning modules for participants to complete asynchronously, and a 3-day synchronous professional learning experience conducted over video conference. Please find an overview of the course elements in the table below:

### Asynchronous Pre-Work

The asynchronous pre-work is comprised of seven Canvas modules available [here](https://virtualvirginia.instructure.com/courses/13038) which cover the basics of coding in Java. Participants must register for the professional learning course on [CodeVA's website](https://www.codevirginia.org/educators/professional-development/), and then enroll themselves in the Canvas course via [this link](TODO:) so they can complete the pre-work *prior* to the summer professional learning sessions, if possible. Each module should take ~2 hours to complete, but the time required may vary from person to person. Participants should expect to complete one module per week in the weeks leading up to the summer sessions. **You are not required to complete the pre-work prior to attending the summer sessions, but we *highly* recommend working through as many modules as you can prior to the first summer session.**

Each module contains tutorials, practice multiple choice questions, a mini-project to help participants practice their skills, and a discussion board for participants to share their work.

Here are some more details about the asynchronous modules:

| Title                 | Description | Recommended Due Date |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 1: Processing Basics  | Learn how to call methods and create coded visual art using Processing | May 24th, 2022 |
| 2: Variables & Types  | Learn about creating programs that store and recall information | June 1st, 2022 |
| 3: Boolean & Loops    | Learn how to use looping control structures to enhance your Java programs | June 7th, 2022 |
| 4: "If" Statements    | Learn how to write control structures that allow the computer to make automated decisions | June 14th, 2022 |
| 5: Processing Methods | Learn how to create animations and interactive Processing programs | June 21st, 2022 |
| 6: Custom Methods     | Learn how to organize your programs into functional components, allowing you to create more complex work | June 28th, 2022 |
| 7: Summative Project  | Create an original program using Processing and Java, building on the skills and knowledge you developed during the previous modules | July 5th, 2022 |

The "recommended due dates" above are just those--recommended. If you registered after the due dates in the table above and did not get access to the module in time to complete them, that's totally fine! **Everyone is welcome to attend the summer sessions, regardless of whether or not they have complete the asynchronous pre-work.** Just finish as much as you have time for!

The asynchronous pre-work modules are available to participants during and after the summer professional learning sessions to allow participants to review and engage in continued practice during the summer and subsequent school year.

### 3-Day Synchronous Sessions

The summer *Programming Using Java* course is comprised of three synchronous sessions, each containing a morning of interactive professional learning and an afternoon of hands-on collaborative work among participants. Participants should expect to engage in hands-on coding, teaching, and writing with their cohort of fellow teachers as they learn the basics of coding and teaching students to code with Java and Processing.

## Getting Support

CodeVA believes that the best professional learning experiences facilitate dialogue among facilitators and participants, allowing facilitators to meet participants' individualized needs. Throughout the *Programming Using Java* professional learning experience, participants will have access to knowledgable CodeVA facilitators who will provide generalized and individualized support to ensure every participants has a positive experience while engaging with the course. Many CodeVA facilitators are experienced, full-time computer science educators teaching in Virginia, and each one has a wealth of knowledge to offer to participants.

**Getting Support for the Asynchronous Modules:** A CodeVA facilitator monitors & engages with participants in the asynchronous Canvas course up until the start of the summer sessions. They read discussion boards, assess projects and quiz results, and engage participants' questions and concerns on the course "Support" discussion board. If you have a question or you need additional support to complete the pre-work, please reach out to your course facilitator via direct message on Canvas and they will work with you to address your learning needs.

**Getting Support During the Synchronous Sessions:** CodeVA summer professional learning sessions are interactive and responsive to participants' goals and needs. You will have ample opportunity during the professional learning sessions to ask for help or additional support, especially during the afternoon hands-on collaborative portion of the session. Your facilitator is also more than willing to provide individualized support outside of the training session; don't hesitate to reach out via direct message or email if you need additional support to be successful during the summer sessions.
