# Processing Installation

This course uses *Processing* to teach Java. *Processing* is a program that runs on your computer; you'll use it as a place to type your code and test it out as you learn.

You will need to install the *Processing Development Environment* on the computer you plan to use to complete this course. [Click here to access the download page on the Processing website](https://processing.org/download). Follow the instructions to download and install Processing. If you complete the installation correctly, you should see a screen similar to this one:

![An empty Processing editor](64618102)

The following image summarizes the main components of this screen:

You can also [click here to learn more about the Processing environment](https://processing.org/environment/#processing-development-environment-pde). There is no need to read more than a few paragraphs for now, so try not to get overwhelmed with all the information there. You can always revisit this page later to learn more.
