# Welcome to Programming with Java!

Hello! Welcome to the CodeVA *Programming with Java* professional learning course! We are so happy you are here.

This course is prerequisite work for teachers who are signed up for Code VAâ€™s summer Professional Development course on Java programming. The modules in this course explore the basics of Java programming with the user-friendly and visually-oriented Processing environment. The goal of the course is to provide teachers with background knowledge about coding and Java so we can focus on more advanced skills and pedagogy during the summer professional learning sessions.

No prior experience with coding is required to complete this course. It is designed for teachers who are brand new to Java. Even if you have some experience, working through the course will ensure that everyone has a chance to develop a common set of skills ahead of the summer professional learning sessions.
