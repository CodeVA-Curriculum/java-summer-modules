# About This Course

You can work through the modules *asynchronously* at your own pace. Each module takes about 2 hours to complete, but you may need more or less time depending on your experience and prior coding knowledge. 

We recommend working on one module per week. If you prefer to complete the course in one sitting, please allow at least 3 full days to work through the material. 

## Course Outline

Here's a brief overview of the topics this course will cover:

* Module 1: Processing Basics and Calling Methods
* Module 2: Variables, Colors, Random, and Math Operations
* Module 3: "While" Loops
* Module 4: "If" Statements
* Module 5: Processing Structure
* Module 6: Custom Methods 
* Module 7: Summative Project

Each module includes learning objectives, vocabulary, tutorials, practice problems, discussion boards, and programming projects. To maximize your learning, practice new skills frequently, take notes as you go, and save your program files in an organized manner.
