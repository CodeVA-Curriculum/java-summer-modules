This discussion board is a catch all to report errors or ask questions, including:

* Errors in a program that you cannot solve or that you have a question about
* Typos in one of the modules
* Questions about an explanation in one of the modules or programs

When you submit a response, clearly identify the module number and the particular section you are working on, along with a description of your question or error.

You can also respond to other participants posts if you can offer help or suggestions.
