# Module 2 Introduction

This module has to do with how we use Java to control how the computer stores and recalls information for later. So far, you've just controlled the *output* of your computer using methods. The computer can also keep track of data internally using *variables*, and then recall that data later on. This "memory" is useful in a lot of situations; creating and managing information stored in variables is a foundational programming skill.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Identify different data types used in Java programs
* Determine appropriate data types for different kinds of information
* Predict the output of Java programs that assign and modify the values of variables
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use variables and a variety of data types
* Read, test, debug, and write Java programs that use arithmetic operations

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| variable | A "container" in a program to hold data for future reference |
| variable declaration | Specifying the type of data stored in the variable with the variable’s name |
| variable initialization | Assigning an initial value to a variable |
| data type | Classification of data, for example numeric vs. text-based |
| primitive types | Java’s 8 basic data types: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `double`, `float`, `char`, and `boolean` |
| object types | Grouping of primitives and/or other objects that define characteristics of an object. Java and Processing provide some object types and programmers can make their own types too |
| void | Java reserved word that indicates a method where no value is returned |
| RGB | Red, Green, Blue values ranging from 0-255 that combine to make a color |
| `color()` | A method that returns an integer representing an RGB color value |
| `random()` | A method that returns a random floating point value in a specified range. |
| typecasting | Converting a value from one data type to another (e.g., converting a `float` value to a whole number `int` value) |
