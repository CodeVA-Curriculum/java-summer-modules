# Module 2 Introduction

This module has to do with how we use Java to control how the computer stores and recalls information for later. So far, you've just controlled the *output* of your computer using methods. The computer can also keep track of data internally using *variables*, and then recall that data later on. This "memory" is useful in a lot of situations; creating and managing information stored in variables is a foundational programming skill.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Identify different data types used in Java programs
* Determine appropriate data types for different kinds of information
* Predict the output of Java programs that assign and modify the values of variables
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use variables and a variety of data types
* Read, test, debug, and write Java programs that use arithmetic operations

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| data type | definition |
| primitive type | definition |
| object type | definition |
| String | definition |
| integer | definition |
