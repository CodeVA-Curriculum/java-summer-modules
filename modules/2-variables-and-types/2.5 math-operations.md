# Mathematical Operations with Variables

TODO: introduction, using mathematical expressions to express relationships between variables

## Simple Operations

You can use the following mathematical **operators** to direct the compyuter to perform calculations with numeric primitive types (like `int` and `float`):

* `+` (add)
* `-` (subtract)
* `*` (multiply)
* `/` (divide)

When the computer encounters mathematical operations as it executes your code, it will resolve the operation before using the value it represents. For example, these two lines of code are functionally identical:

```java
ellipse(200, 200, 50, 50);
ellipse(100*2, 150+50, 100/2, 50);
```

The computer resolves each of the mathematical expressions in the parameter slots before executing the `ellipse` command on line 2.

TODO: example with variables

The code below uses both of these types of mathematical expressions (expressions with literal values, and expressions with variables). Consider each section of the code separately, and spend some time tracing the code.

```java
TODO: example
```

TODO: explanations

> Why do you think the programmer chose to calculate the values of the `trunkWidth` and `trunkHeight` variables based on the value of the `radius` variable? What are each of these variables used for in the code?

## Complex Operations

We can use parenthesis `()` as grouping symbols and use multiple operators to perform more complex calculations. Hard brackets `[ ]` and curly braces `{}` are not valid grouping symbols. Java follows the usual order of operations commonly referred to as PEMDAS, with parenthesis evaluated first, then exponents (which we will not cover here), multiplication/division from left to right, and addition/subtraction from left to right. Here is an example with complex operations:

> **Practice:** See if you can trace through the code below and predict the three numbers the program will print to your console area. When you think you have a reasonable prediction, run the code and see if you are right!

> Recall from module 1 that tracing requires us to understand each line of code, one line at a time and that this process can be slow. As you trace each line of code, keep track of the current state (value) of each variable. Recall that a variable can only hold one value at a time and that the = sign is used to assign a new value to a variable.

```java
float x = 3;
float num = 10 - 7 * x;
println(num);

num = (10 - 7) * x;
println(num);

x = 6;
float y = 24;
num = y / x * 10;
println(num);
```

Notice that you still need to include the multiplication symbol to multiply a value by the result of a parentheses-bounded expression. For example, in math class you might write `(10-7)x`, but with Java you have to write it explicitly as `(10-7)*x`.
