# Module 2 Mini-Project

In this mini-project, you'll use variables to add color to the *Monochrome Tree Program* from the previous module to demonstrate your ability to initialize and use variables in a Processing program.

**Copy the program below into your Processing environment (or copy your mini-project code from the previous module), and add color and some randomness using the `color()` and `random()` methods.**

```java
// Monochrome Tree Program

// TODO: create your variables here
int sky_color = color(250, 250, 250);

// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(sky_color); // Draw a background 

// title
textSize(32);
fill(0); // set text color
text("Help the planet. Plant a tree!", 50, 50);
  
// tree
fill(75); // set shape color  
rect(310, 360, 20, 100);   
fill(200); 
circle(320, 350, 100);
```

Feel free to use examples from previous pages in this module as a guide. Here are some suggestions for what to add:

1. Create two `color` variables and use them to set the color of the tree trunk and leaves, respectively.
2. Use `random()` to generate a random number, then use that number to a) set the height of the tree, and 2) set the size of the "branches" (hint: use a mathematical expression to adapt the random number to the appropriate "size" parameter range).
3. Change the value of the `sky_color` variable to set the `background` to blue, rather than grey.

> For an additional challenge, try using `random()` to make the tree leaves a color somewhere between green and orange, so the computer randomly creates either a "spring" or "fall" scene

Be sure to use comments and descriptive variable names to help label the different parts of your program!

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

| Criteria | Goal | Stretch Goal |
| -------- | ---- | ------------ |
| Methods |  |  |
| Variables |  |  |
| Expressiveness |  |  |

<!-- | Criteria  | Advanced | Proficient | Developing |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Methods   | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program makes use of a few methods, but it is unclear that you are comfortable using a variety of methods with different parameters in your programs |
| Variables | Your program initializes, invokes, and modifies variables of several different types throughout the program using arithmetic expressions as appropriate | Your program initializes and uses several variables, and modifies the values of those variables using arithmetic expressions | Your program includes variables, but may either a) create extra, unnecessary variables or b) fail to use variables in appropriate situations (i.e., the use of variables does not affect the results of the code or the readability of the code) |
| Expressiveness  | Your program uses comments and variable names that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it | Your program either does not include any comments, or the comments sometimes fail to accurately describe the code; variable names are arbitrary or misleadingly named | -->
