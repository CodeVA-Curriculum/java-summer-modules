# Module 2 Mini-Project

In this mini-project, you'll use variables to add color to the *Monochrome Tree Program* from the previous module to demonstrate your ability to initialize and use variables in a Processing program.

**Copy the program below into your Processing environment (or copy your mini-project code from the previous module), and add color and some randomness using the `color()` and `random()` methods.**

```java
TODO:
```

Here are some suggestions for what to add:

1. Lorem ipsum
2. Lorem ipsum
3. Use the `background()` method to create a blue sky (check it out in the [Processing reference](TODO:))

> For an additional challenge, try using `random()` to make the tree leaves a color somewhere between green and orange, so the computer randomly creates either a "spring" or "fall" scene

Be sure to use comments and descriptive variable names to help label the different parts of your program!

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

<!-- | Criteria  | Advanced | Proficient | Developing |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Methods   | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program makes use of a few methods, but it is unclear that you are comfortable using a variety of methods with different parameters in your programs |
| Comments  | Your program uses lots of comments that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code, but not enough for someone to immediately understand the program without tracing it | Your program either does not include any comments, or the comments sometimes fail to accurately describe the code | -->
