# Adding Color Variables

In this module, you'll learn how to add *color* to shapes and other visual elements in your Processing programs using variables, the `color()` method, and the `fill()` method. Check out the following code example, which adds color to the shapes you've created in previous modules:

```java
// Color Tree Program

// colors
int blue = color(157, 227, 250);  // (red, green, blue) or (R, G, B)
int green = color(46, 179, 93);
int brown = color(92, 81, 59);
      
// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(blue); // Draw a background 

// title
textSize(32);
fill(0); // set text color; 0 is black
text("Help the planet. Plant a tree!", 50, 50);
  
// tree
fill(brown); // set shape color  
rect(310, 360, 20, 100);   
fill(green); 
circle(320, 350, 100);
```

You probably noticed some new, potentially unfamiliar code patterns at the top of the code where the program directs the computer to create the variables called `blue`, `green`, and `brown`. The following section explains this pattern, and how you can include it in your own programs to add color to your designs.

## Adding Color Using the `color()` Method

Every method directs the computer to perform a task. Some methods direct the computer to display shapes (e.g., `ellipse`, `rect`), and some direct the computer to produce, or `return`, a value for the program to make use of later in the instruction set. Consider these lines from the new Tree program:

```java
// colors
int blue = color(157, 227, 250);  // (red, green, blue) or (R, G, B)
int green = color(46, 179, 93);
int brown = color(92, 81, 59);
```

Here's a narrative description of what the computer does as it executes this code, starting on line 2 (after the comment):

* Declare an `int` type variable called `blue`
* Call the `color` method with parameters `(157, 227, 250)`
* The `color()` method performs a task and produces (`returns`) an integer value
* The `blue` variable gets the (`=`) integer value returned by the `color` method

The methods weâ€™ve used so far, like `text` and `rect` do not return a value. Other kinds of methods, like `color` will return a value to your program as part of their task. The Processing reference contains details about what type of data a method returns, if any. Click the links on [`text`](https://processing.org/reference/text_.html), [`rect`](https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html), and [`circle`](https://processing.org/reference/color_.html) to find their return type in the Processing reference. The word `void` indicates that a method does not return a value at all. Most of the methods we will be working with are `void` methods. The `color` method returns a single `int` value that represents a color.

After the program initalizes the variable called `blue` with the value returned by the `color` method, it can use that `int` value in other methods to set the color of different elements on the screen. The program above uses `blue` in the `background()` method to set the background color of the application window. Here's the code in isolation (you can copy and paste this code into your Processing environment to see how it works):

:::code-example{src="https://placekitten.com/400/400"}
```java
int blue = color(157, 227, 250);

size(800, 600);
background(blue);
```

### Setting RGB `color()` Values

RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue color strands. Each strand can have a value between 0 and 255, signifying intensity.  With paint, maximizing and mixing colors produces black, but computer screens use light to produce colors, so it helps to think of each RGB value as an amount of light, where 0 indicates the light is off and 255 indicates the light is on as bright as it can be. So, the RGB value (0, 0, 0) creates black and the maximum value (255, 255, 255) creates white. Other colors are made with in between values.

In order to select the RGB values for a particular color, look under the Processing menu `Tools>Color Selector` for a tool to help. With this tool, you can select a color to see the corresponding RGB values or you can type in RGB values to see the corresponding color.

### Practice with the `color()` Method

> Use the color selector tool to determine the RGB value for the color yellow. Create a new variable for the color in the updated Tree program, and then use the variable, the `fill()` method, and the `circle()` method to add a sun to the picture. Unfold the collapsed area below to see an example.
