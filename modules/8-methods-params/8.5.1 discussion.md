# Module 8 Mini-Project Gallery & Discussion

Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of a program that you created for the *Module 8 Mini-Project*.

Then, in the same post, respond to the following reflective questions:

1. Designing, writing, debugging, and tracing code takes practice. What are some tips you’ve used or learned in this course that you can give to a student who is struggling with one of the following: designing a program, writing custom methods, tracing the steps of the code, or tracing values of global and local variables? 
2. The `rect()` method is overloaded so that the corners of the rectangle can be curved ([see reference](https://processing.org/reference/rect_.html)). This feature could’ve been offered as a new method, with a new name, like `softRect()`, but they made a design choice to overload the method instead. Why do you think the programmer made this design choice? What are some benefits with each approach?

> We'd love to use your work as an example in future trainings; please leave a note on this discussion board post if you are okay with us using your code, images of your program output, or the text of your reflections anonymously in future trainings.
