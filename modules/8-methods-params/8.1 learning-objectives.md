# Module 8 Introduction

In this module, you’ll learn about creating custom methods by incorporating input parameters and return values into those methods. Methods are like little, self-contained programs that run inside your larger program—parameters allow you to provide “input” to methods, and return values allow methods to produce output. You’ll also see how using local variables makes it easier for programmers to maintain and debug code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Write methods with input parameters and return values
* Write methods that are overloaded
* Read, test, and debug simple Java programs that use developer-defined methods with and without input parameters and return values

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| argument | The value(s) passed to a method being called. |
| constant | Data that does not change value throughout the program. |
| parameter | Variables defined in a method header to receive input values for the method to use when performing its function. |
| overloading | Two or more methods with the same name, but a different number or type of parameters. |
| return | a Java keyword used to exit a method. The return statement may also include a value to return to the calling statement upon exit. |
