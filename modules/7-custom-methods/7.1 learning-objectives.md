# Module 7 Introduction

You may have noticed that, oftentimes, your programs contain several parts, each with their own related variables, conditional statements, and method calls. These sections of code "belong" together, and organizing them this way in your program makes your program easier for other people to read (and easier for you to make changes to). This module is about recognizing those functional components, and organizing them into methods that you define. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Decompose a program into functional components
* Trace the execution of a program that includes developer-defined methods
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use developer-defined methods

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| method call | definition |
| method declaration/definition | definition |
