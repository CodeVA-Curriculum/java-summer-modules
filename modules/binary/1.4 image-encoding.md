# Image Encoding & Encryption

In this project, you'll do two things:

1. Compress an image so it uses less binary information
2. Encrypt some image data to hide its content

## Project Instructions

Follow the steps below to complete the project:

### Step 1: Compression

The black-and-white image below isn't very high-resolution--it is only 16x16 pixels. Nevertheless, you need to compress it down to 8x8 pixels. You can use whatever method you like to compress it, as long as:

1. The new version of the image is more-or-less recognizable as a lower-resolution version of the original image
2. The method is *systematic* (meaning you could follow the same method to compress a different image)
3. The new version of the image fits into a 16x16 grid

You can access a couple of different versions of the image at the links below:

* [A Google Drawings version](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1sdzzEai42sUa1ycM6C-39br59l_OgxZ9W6OenZB4aJM/edit?usp=sharing) you can make a copy of and edit
* [A printable PDF version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hFxILEzwiFuRBPyOEh0RK-iWiGbBsRdm/view?usp=sharing)
* [A `.png` image version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iq_QhDNTx_bzvJo1D4bQBLUYHaq21eI2/view?usp=sharing)

You can also use the 8x8 grid at the links below to create your compressed image:

* [A printable PDF version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-JSk72QCoNYkXlluBc8K0cTRubZewelb/view?usp=sharing)
* [A `.png` image version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qduT2HrXMZTMYiWsMkSDWuIptV2u112x/view?usp=sharing)

Here is an example protocol you could consider using to compress the image:

<!-- ::youtube[A video about compressing the image by hand](TODO:) -->

> The new image is 1/4 the size of the original one. You could take a square of four pixels, and figure out whether the compressed pixel  should be black or white based on the number of black pixels in the original set

*For an additional challenge, try to compress the image to a smaller grid.*

### Step 2: Encryption

Next, try to *encrypt* a low-resolution image by hand using an encryption protocol of your own invention. Your encryption protocol could involve mixing the bits up, adding new bits, or any other method of obsfucation that makes sense to you! Make sure your protocol meets the following requirements:

1. The method is *systematic* (meaning you could follow the same method to encrypt a different set of binary data)
2. The method is *repeatable*; you need to be able to follow the steps backwards to decrypt your image, so don't use a method that involves randomness!
3. The method is doable by hand without computational aids

You can choose to encrypt the compressed binary data from Step #1, or you can create a *new* image on the 16x16 grid and encrypt that one. After you apply your encryption protocol to your binary image data, you should end up with a new set of binary data.

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed the steps above, you're ready to submit your work! For this project you can submit your work via the text entry below. 

1. What compression strategy did you use? What did your image look like at the end? Paste a picture of your compressed image into the submission box, and talk about the strategy you used to create it.
2. Talk about how you encrypted your image data. If you created a new image to encrypt, include it in your response. Then, describe your encryption procedure. Share your new binary data generated by your encryption protocol in the text entry area.
