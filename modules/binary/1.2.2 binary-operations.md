# Peforming Operations with Binary Numbers

When you take the Praxis exam, you may be asked to perform *operations* with binary numbers. These are not all that complicated, but they do require some explaination. The module below provides information about the different binary operations, and how to execute them with pen and paper.

## The NOT Operation

The `NOT` binary operation "flips" the bits of a binary number, reversing the `1` bits to `0` and the `0` bits to `1`. Here's an example:

```diff
NOT 10110110 = 01001001
```

<!-- not.jpg -->
![A binary number 1011 with an arrow pointing down to its result after the NOT operation, 0110. In the top left-corner, the words NOT 0100 = ?? ](66767307)

This one is pretty easy to execute on pen and paper--just write down the binary number, and for each digit write its opposite to arrive at your answer.

## The AND Operation

The `AND` binary operation takes *two* binary numbers and compares each place value. If both of the bits in the same place value are a `1`, then the result also should have a `1` in that place value. If they are different values, or if they are both `0`, then the result should have a `0` in that place value.

This operation is slightly more complicated than the `NOT` operation--the best way to compute `AND` operations is to write the operand binary numbers stacked on top of one another like you're doing long addition.

![Two binary numbers written with one below the other, aligned by place value. In the top left-corner, the words AND 1101 0110 = ?? ](66767301)

Compare each bit vertically, and write the resultant bit based on the following rules:

1. If both bits are `1`, write a `1` on the bottom row
2. Otherwise, write a `0` on the bottom row

```diff
AND 1101 0110 = 0100
```

Here's a graph called a "truth table", which shows all the possible outcomes of performing the AND operation on two sets of bits:

| Operand 1 | Operand 2 | Result |
| --------- | --------- | ------ |
| `0` | `1` | `0` |
| `1` | `0` | `0` |
| `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1` | `1` | `1` |

## The OR Operation

The `OR` operation is like the "opposite" of the `AND` operation--it compares two binary numbers in the same way, looking at each pair of place values one at a time. If both bits are `0`, it produces a `0`; otherwise, it produces a `1` in that place value.

<!-- or.jpg -->
![Two binary numbers written with one below the other, aligned by place value. In the top left-corner, the words OR 1101 0110 = ?? ](66767308)

Compare each bit vertically, and write the resultant bit based on the following rules:

1. If both bits are `0`, write a `0` on the bottom row
2. Otherwise, write a `1` on the bottom row

```diff
OR 1101 0110 = 1111
```

Here's a graph called a "truth table", which shows all the possible outcomes of performing the AND operation on two sets of bits:

| Operand 1 | Operand 2 | Result |
| --------- | --------- | ------ |
| `0` | `1` | `1` |
| `1` | `0` | `1` |
| `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1` | `1` | `1` |

## The XOR Operation

The last operation you'll need to know is the `XOR` operation, or "exclusive `OR`". This operation compares the place value bits of two binary numbers in the same way as `AND` and `OR`. In this operation, however, the result is only a `1` if the two bits are *different* from one another. If they are both `1` or both `0`, then the result is `0`.

Compare each bit vertically, and write the resultant bit based on the following rules:

1. If both bits are `0`, write a `0` on the bottom row
2. If both bits are `1`, write a `0` on the bottom row
2. Otherwise, write a `1` on the bottom row

```diff
XOR 1101 0110 = 1011
```

Here's a graph called a "truth table", which shows all the possible outcomes of performing the AND operation on two sets of bits:

| Operand 1 | Operand 2 | Result |
| --------- | --------- | ------ |
| `0` | `1` | `1` |
| `1` | `0` | `1` |
| `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1` | `1` | `0` |
