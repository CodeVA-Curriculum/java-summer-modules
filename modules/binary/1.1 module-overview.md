# Introduction

This module is all about how computers represent and interpret information. Digital data is all made of binary information, strings of `1`s and `0`s; it's how digital electronics work! However, because computers use a data format that's so different from the data humans actually care about--text, images, sounds, video--computer engineers needed to figure out how to convert that complex, rich, human data into binary. Solving this problem led to all sorts of interesting work figuring out ways to represent information digitally, and ultimately had a big impact on how computers work today.

## Learning Objectives

During this module, you will learn the following skills, practices, and competencies:

1. Understand bits as the universal medium expressing digital information
    a. perform calculations, using bits & bytes
    b. determine the number of bits and bytes required to store a given amount of data
    c. given the description of an encoding scheme, encode or decode data
    d. describe lossy and lossless data compression
    e. explain why binary numbers are fundamental to the operation of computer systems
2. Be familiar with concepts of data encryption & decryption
    a. distinguish between encoding & encryption
    b. identify trade-offs in the use of data encryption
3. Understand numbner base conversion and binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems
    a. convert between bases
    b. analyze and compare representations of numbers in different bases

## Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| binary | A number system where each place value is either a `1` or a `0`; the number system used in computing, where `1` is a "high" voltage value and `0` is a "low" voltage value. |
| decimal | A number system where each place value is one of ten values between `0` and `9`; the number system people use in common practice |
| hexadecimal | A number system where each place value is one of 16 values between `0` and `F`; used as a compact notation for computational data, where each pair of hexadecimal digits is equal to one **byte** of binary data. |
| number system | A system of counting and computation with a "base", referring the quantity of possible values in each place value in the numerical notation. For example, our normal number system is "base-10" because each place value has ten possible values (any value between `0` and `9`). |
| bit | A single place value in a binary number, with a value of either `1` or `0`; the fundamental unit of data measurement in computing. |
| byte | An amount of data comprised of eight bits, representing any value between `0` and `255`. |
| encode | The process by which data is converted from one representation to another, often from a "human-readable" representation to a binary representation. |
| decode | The process by which data is converted from a non-human-readable representation to a human-readable one. |
| encrypt | The process by which data is obsfucated using a systematic process such that it becomes unreadable. |
| decrypt | The process by which encyrpted data is restored to its readable format using a systematic process, often one that requires a "key" (a secret piece of information which allows for decryption). |
| compression (lossless, lossy) | Simplifying a set of data such that it takes up less space, i.e. requires fewer bits of binary data to store and recall it. Lossy compression results in a lower-fidelity, but recognizable version of the original data. Lossless compression results in a smaller file size, but retains the original data content. |
| protocol | A systematic, repeatable process; a set of rules, often used to guide encoding or encryption processes. |

## Prerequisite Information

This module has **no suggested prerequisites**. 

We recommend completing *at least* the "Digital Representations", "Encoding & Decoding", and "Image Encoding Project" elements of this module before completing the "Networking & the Internet" synchronous session and its associated work.
