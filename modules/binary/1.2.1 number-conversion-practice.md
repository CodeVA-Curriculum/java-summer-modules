# Binary Conversion Practice

When you take the *Computer Science Praxis Exam*, you'll need to be able to convert numbers between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations. The method by which you accomplish this is totally up to you, but it's a good idea to get some practice and figure out what strategy works best for you. Here are some strategies for you to think about using as you work through the multiple choice questions on this quiz:

## Decimal To and From Binary

Converting numbers to and from binary and decimal is pretty easy! All you need to know is some basics about the place values of binary numbers, and be able to do some mental math (mostly just addition and multiplying by two).

### Arithmetic/Chart Method

This method is, for me, the easiest one to remember. It involves drawing a simple chart, and using some basic ideas about place value to easily convert between systems using mental math. You can find a printable version of the chart (the *Binary Flippy-Do*) I used in the video above [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1byw1hYMWJDv3N4oJz827j6KHnc58LIIBPGMmxctfPvM/edit?usp=sharing). Cut along the dotted lines to create flaps, and then write `1` on the backside of each flap. You should end up with something like this:

To convert from binary to decimal:

1. First, set up your flippy-do so it's showing all `0`s
2. Next, enter your binary number into the "Binary" row, with one digit per box using the flaps on the flippy-do
3. Look at each digit in the "Binary" row. If it's a `1`, record the "Place Value" number on a scratch sheet of paper
4. Once you have recorded the place values for each `1` in your binary number, sum the recorded place values together to calculate the decimal version of your binary number.

To convert from decimal to binary:

1. First, set up your flippy-do so it's showing all `0`s
2. Next, compare your decimal number to the place value in the left-most column:
3. If the place value is less than your decimal number, turn the flap for that column to `1` and subtract the place value from your decimal number. Record the difference on scratch paper--this is your "working decimal". If the place value is more than your decimal number, keep the flap on `0`
4. Move on to the next column, and repeat steps #2 & #3 using your "working decimal" as your new decimal number. Repeat until you reach the final place value.
5. If you end up with zero as your working decimal, you're done! If your working decimal is greater than zero at the end, it means you need a longer flippy-do!

If you need to use the flippy-do for longer binary numbers, you can print the [blank flippy-do linked here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1bK4JnADo-iMyLnoK1v17CXltE0y54h5y9WjU8Fa0oKY/edit?usp=sharing) and extend it! Just add the subsequent powers of two, calculate the place value, and you're ready to go!

### Graph Method

This method is very handy if you are a little uncomfortable with mental math. It involves a little bit more memorization, but it can also be a lot faster than the *Arithmetic/Chart Method*, especially with smaller binary numbers. You can find a printable version of the chart I used in the video above [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Qc7Arhbp1DIiLaf-RzIlMti-hhF8GEn8IZubTKt9ZxQ/edit?usp=sharing). Follow the steps below to convert from decimal to binary and back again! 

> **Note:** This method only works with binary numbers up to 5 bits long.

1. First, fill out your chart. Start in the top-left corner with `0`<sub>10</sub>, and work your way across and down. By the end, your chart should look something like this:

<!-- grid.jpg -->
![A four by eight grid with numbers from zero to thirty-two](66767306)

2. Place a token (an eraser or penny works well for this) on the `0` square in the top-left corner. You'll move the token around the board according to a set of rules, and when you're done the token will be on the square that corresponds to the decimal version of the binary number.

3. Next, read the left-most (largest place value) bit. If the bit is a `1`, move the token *four rows down*. If it is `0`, do nothing.  We'll use the binary number `11011`<sub>2</sub> as an example; the left-most digit is a `1`, so I'll move my token four rows down.

<!-- four-down.jpg -->
![The grid from before, with an arrow showing how to move the token four rows down](66767446)

4. Next, read the second-to-left-most bit. If the bit is a `1`, move the token *two rows down*. If it is `0`, do nothing. For our example `11011`<sub>2</sub> the left-most digit is a `1`, so I'll move my token two rows down.

<!-- two-down.jpg -->
![The grid from before, with an arrow showing how to move the token two rows down](66767449)

4. Next, read the third digit from the left. If it's a `1`, move *one row down*. If it's a `0`, do nothing. For our example `11011`<sub>2</sub> the digit in question is `0`, so we will do nothing.

<!-- one-down-dotted.jpg -->
![The grid from before, with a dotted-line arrow showing how I would move the token one row down if the digit were 1](66767447)

5. Next, read the fourth digit from the left. If it's a `1`, move *two spaces right*. If it's a `0`, do nothing. For our example `11011`<sub>2</sub> the digit in question is a `1`, so I'll move my token two spaces to the right.

<!-- two-right.jpg -->
![The grid from before, with an arrow showing how I moved the token two spaces right](66767450)

6. Finally, look at the last digit. If it's a `1`, move *one space right*. If it's a `0`, do nothing. For our example `11011`<sub>2</sub> the digit in question is a `1`, so I'll move my token one space to the right.

<!-- one-right.jpg -->
![The grid from before, with an arrow showing how I moved the token one space right](66767448)

The space you've landed on is the binary number in decimal form! To convert from decimal back to binary, follow the steps in reverse:

1. Place your token on the decimal number you'd like to convert to binary.
2. If your token has a space to move *four rows up*, move your token and write `1` as the first digit in your binary number. If there isn't space on the grid to move two rows up, write a `0`.
3. If your token has space to move *two rows up*, after step #2, move your token and write `1` as the first digit in your binary number. If there isn't space on the grid to move two rows up, write a `0`.
4. If your token has space to *one row up* after step #3, move your token and write `1` as the second digit in your binary number. If there isn't space on the grid to move one row up at this point, write a `0` as your second digit.
5. If your token has space on the grid to move *two spaces left*, move your token and write `1` as the third digit in your binary number. If isn't space on the grid to move two spaces left, write a `0`.
6. Finally, if your token has space on the grid to move *one space left*, move your token and write `1` as the fourth digit in your binary number. Your token should end on zero when you've finished!

## Binary To and From Hexadecimal

::youtube[A video explaining some binary and hexadecimal conversion strategies]{#-3xQCriO6-c}

Binary and hexadecimal are closely linked, and converting between them isn't all that complicated. You could, of course, convert your starting number to decimal and then convert *that* number, but that's actually a little harder than it needs to be.

The best way to think about the relationship between binary & hexadecimal is that *each hex digit represents 4 binary digits*. So before you even begin the conversion process, you know that the hex number `A9` is 8 bits long. Then, you can convert each 4-bit section of your number separately, and then combine them to find your final answer. Here are the steps for converting between binary and hexadecimal in detail:

## Chunking Method

1. First determine the length of the number you will end up with at the end, based on your starting number. A hexadecimal number has *one* digit for every *four* bits in its binary representation, and vice versa.
2. Next, break the number up into 4-bit sections. If you're converting the binary number `10011101` to hex, you would break up the 8-bit number into two sections: `1001`<sub>2</sub> and `1101`<sub>2</sub>. If you were converting the hex number `3F`, you would break it up into two hex digits: `3` and `F`.
3. Treat the two sections of your number as two separate numbers, and use one of the conversion methods above to convert the smaller 4-bit number to the target format. For example, the hex number `3F` has two digits, `3` and `F`. `3` in decimal is `3` (easy!) so `3` in binary is `0011`. `F` in decimal is `15` (it's the highest number hex can represent with one place value), and `15` in binary is `1111` (also the highest number 4 bits can represent!).
4. Once you have converted the 4-bit chunks, combine them in order to find your final answer. In the example from step #3 (converting `3F` from hex to binary), the two chunks are `0011` and `1111`. So, to find `3F` in binary, combine the two 4-bit chunks: `00111111`.

Here's an example using a very large hexadecimal number: `A45DE7F0`<sub>16</sub>. Using mental math to convert this number is very challenging! So instead, we'll use the method above to break the number up into meaningful 4-bit numbers that are easier to convert, and then combine the binary chunks to find the final binary representation.

| Hex Chunk | Binary Chunk |
| --------- | -------------- |
| `A4`<sub>16</sub> | 10100100<sub>2</sub> |
| `5D`<sub>16</sub> | 01011101<sub>2</sub> |
| `E7`<sub>16</sub> | 11100111<sub>2</sub> |
| `F0`<sub>16</sub> | 11110000<sub>2</sub> |

Put all the binary chunks together, and you get your result: `10100100010111011110011111110000`<sub>2</sub>.

## Hexadecimal To and From Decimal

In general, you'd be well-served by trying to learn how to "read" hexadecimal rather than learning a conversion method. It's not actually all that hard--the first nine digits of hexadecimal are the same as decimal. `0` in decimal is `0` in hex, `1` is `1`, all the way up to `9`. The part that's different are the numbers between `9` and `16`--instead of writing ten as `10`, you write `A` in hex. Here's a table with all the values between `9` and `F`:

| `0-9` | `10` | `11` | `12` | `13` | `14` | `15` |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `0-9` | `A`  | `B`  | `C`  | `D`  | `E`  | `F`  |

Even if you see a strange number, you can pretty much count on your fingers as long as you remember that `A` is "ten", and `F` is "fifteen". Remembering these simple notational rules is the easiest way to convert single-digit hexadecimal numbers (numbers from zero to fifteen) to and from decimal.

### Arithmetic Method

Converting two-digit hexadecimal numbers is a little trickier than converting one-digit numbers. If you are alright with doing a little mental math, using arithmetic is probably the fastest way to convert between decimal and hexadecimal. Follow the steps below to convert a two-digit hex number to decimal:

1. Figure out the values of each of the digits. For example, the hex number `9F` has two digits; the first is equal to nine, and the second is equal to fifteen.
2. Multiply the first digit by sixteen, and then add it to the last digit. The result is the number in decimal form.

To convert larger hex numbers, follow the steps below:

1. Evaluate the largest place value by mulitplying it by sixteen raised to the power of the number of digits "behind" it. For example, you would determine the value of the `B` digit in the hex number `B3AF` by calculating `11 * (16^3)`, because `B` is `11` in decimal, and there are `3` digits after the `B`.
2. Repeat step 1 for each of the place values in hex number.
3. Add all the values together. The result is the decimal version of the number.

This method is a lot harder in reverse, unfortunately.

### Two-Step Method

If you feel pretty good about your binary conversion skills, you might find it easier to convert the the decimal or hexadecimal number to binary before trying to convert it to your target format. I find this method to be the most reliable method to convert decimal numbers to and from hexadecimal ones, but it does require a pretty strong grasp of binary conversions. Here are the steps:

1. Complete the *Binary <-> Hexadecimal Chunking Method* above to get the binary version of the hex number.
2. Complete the *Binary <-> Decimal* method of your choice (see above) to get the decimal version of the hex number you started with.

For example, `A5` is `10100101` in binary, which is `165` in decimal.
