# "If" Statement Practice

The following examples use "if" and "if-else" to 

* reset coordinate values to prevent shapes from going off the screen
* set attributes of a shape based on probability
* set attributes of a shape based on a counter value

## Example 1: Reset Coordinates

This program uses a "while" loop with an "if" statement to draw rows of squares. The loop draws one row of squares and when it reaches the right edge of the screen, an "if" statement resets the `x` coordinate and increases the `y` coordinate in order to begin the next row of squares.

:::code-example{src="64725823" alt="The output of the program above, displaying a grid of white squares on a grey background"}
```java {13-17}
size(640,480);
int size = 40;	// length & width of squares
int offset = 9;	// space between squares
int x = offset;
int y = 0;
while (y <= 480)	// while y coordinate is still inside the screen
{
   // draw square
   rect(x, y, size, size);
   
   // adjust coordinates for next square
   x = x + size + offset;	
   if (x > 640)			// if x coordinate is off the screen
   {
      x = offset;			// reset x coordinate
      y = y + size + offset; // increment y coordinate to the next row
   }
}
```
:::

Checking coordinate values against boundaries (like the screen’s edge) is an important skill in graphics programs, so study this example carefully. Note that drawing a shape outside the screen boundaries does not produce an error; the shape is simply not visible. In later modules, we will actually use this to our advantage to create animations, but here we only want to draw visible shapes. Plus, if we never instruct the computer to move on to the next row, the program will only draw one row of squares!

Your turn! Change the code to draw the squares one column at a time (instead of one row at a time).. Use the code below as a starting point, and fill in the "while" loop. You shouldn’t need to change any of the code outside of the loop. Use the button below to reveal the answer if you need help or you want to check your work:

```java
// starting code
size(640,480);
int size = 40;	// length & width of squares
int offset = 9;	// space between squares
int x = 0;
int y = offset;
while (x <= 640)	// while x coordinate is still inside the screen
{
   // draw square
   rect(x, y, size, size);
   
   // add code here
}
```

   if(y > 480) {
	y = offset;
	x = x + size + offset;
   }
}
```

## Example 2: Probability

You can also use “if” statements to model real-world phenomena. According to [this article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/53739189#:~:text=Research%20suggests%20that%20between%20ten,a%20lefty%20is%20pretty%20cool.), 10-12% of people are left-handed (we will use 10% for this example). In this picture, the blue squares represent right-handed people and the yellow squares represent left-handed people.

:::code-example{src="64725824" alt="The output of the program above, displaying a grid of squares; some are yellow, most are blue"}
```java {2-3, 8, 12-21}
size(640,480);
int yellow = color(255, 255, 0);
int blue = color(0, 0, 255);
int size = 40;  // length & width of squares
int offset = 9;  // space between squares
int x = offset;
int y = 0;
float chance;	// variable to hold probability

while (y <= 480)  // while y coordinate is still inside the screen
{
   // set color of square based on probability
   chance = random(0,1);  
   if (chance < 0.10)	// 10% left-handed
   {
      fill(yellow);
   }
   else  // 90% right-handed
   { 
      fill(blue);
   }
   
   // draw square
   rect(x, y, size, size);
   
   // adjust coordinates for next square
   x = x + size + offset; 
   if (x > 640)      // if x coordinate is off the screen
   {
      x = offset;      // reset x coordinate
      y = y + size + offset; // increment y coordinate to the next row
   }
}
```

This code for this program is similar to *Example 1* (the new additions to the code are highlighted above). The code generates a random decimal value between `0` and `1` and uses the result to set each square’s color using an "if-else" statement. Specifically, it assigns yellow for a random value between `0.0` and `0.09` and blue for a value between `0.10` and `0.99`.

There are 130 squares in the picture, so 10% is exactly 13 squares. The picture above, however, only has 11 squares colored yellow. Due to the nature of random values, each program execution will contain a different number of yellow squares and they will be in different locations for each run. With a good random number generator, though, when we look at multiple executions of the program over time, most should have close to 13 yellow squares and there should be more instances where there are 13 than any other number. You could also increase the number of squares in the visualization. This is sort of like doing a random sample; the more people you ask, the closer your sample will get to representing the “real” statistics from the total population.

Another way to code this solution is to set the fill color to blue and change it to yellow if necessary:

```java
// set color of square based on probability
chance = random(0,1); 
fill(blue); 
if (chance < 0.10) {
    fill(yellow);
    // ...
```

You try it! Change the code to use a different shape rather than a different color to represent different values.

## Example 3: Counter

What if you wanted to represent 10%, but not in a random pattern like before?

Instead of using a random value, we can use a counter that counts the squares as we go and then change the color after a certain threshold is reached. Note that in this example, we have to calculate how many squares we want to be yellow. This code for this program is also similar to Example 1 (the new additions to the code are highlighted below)

:::code-example{src="64725822" alt="The output of the program above, displaying a grid of squares. The top row is yellow, the rest are blue"}
```java {2-3, 8-9, 13-18}
size(640,480);
int yellow = color(255, 255, 0);
int blue = color(0, 0, 255);
int size = 40;  // length & width of squares
int offset = 9;  // space between squares
int x = offset;
int y = 0;
int counter = 0;
fill(yellow);

while (y <= 480)  // while y coordinate is still inside the screen
{
   // change color of square based on counter
   counter = counter + 1;
   if (counter == 14)
   {
      fill(blue);
   }
   
   // draw square
   rect(x, y, size, size);
   
   // adjust coordinates for next square
   x = x + size + offset; 
   if (x > 640)      // if x coordinate is off the screen
   {
      x = offset;      // reset x coordinate
      y = y + size + offset; // increment y coordinate to the next row
   }
}
```
:::

In this example, the color is set outside the loop and is changed inside the loop using the "if" statement as soon as the threshold is met. We also could’ve used an "if-else" inside the loop instead to set the color on every iteration.

Can you rewrite the program to produce the following output, where every 10th square is yellow?
