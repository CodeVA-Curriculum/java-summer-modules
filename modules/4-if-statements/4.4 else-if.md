# "Else-If" Statements

So far, the “if” statements you’ve written have involved the computer making a choice between two options; either to do *something* or to do *nothing* (as in a simple “if” statement) or to do *something* or *something else* (as in an “if-else” statement). But what if you want the computer to make a choice between even more options? No problem! You can chain "if-else" statements together, creating multiple paths for your program to take. These statements can get large and complex, and subtle nuances can change how the statement is evaluated; check your syntax if you run into weird errors. 

Here is the syntax of an "else-if" or "if-else-if" statement, also called a “nested if" statement (because the instruction set for one “branch” of the control structure contains another control structure inside of it):

```java
if (/*boolean expression is true*/)
{
	// do something
}
else
{
    if (/*a different boolean expression is true*/)
    {
        // do a different something
    }
    else
    {
        // do another different something 
    }
}
```

Some programmers prefer to format the "else-if" code like this:

```java
if (/*boolean expression is true*/)
{
	// do something
}
else if (/*a different boolean expression is true*/)
{
    // do a different something
}
else // (could be another else-if here…)
{
    // do another different something 
}
```

The two formats are equivalent; they both provide three paths with three different code blocks. In both formats, the computer takes one (and only one!) path of the three, so you should expect the computer to only execute one of the code blocks. The first Boolean expression that is `true` causes the associated code block to execute, and then the computer jumps to the code after the "else-if". **Even if another Boolean expression is true, the computer only executes the code for the first `true` path**. If none are `true`, then the computer executes the `else` path. You can continue to chain "else-if" statements in this manner to produce more than three paths, but there should only be one dangling else (without an if) at the end.

Now you can use an "else-if" to create a program with more than 2 possible outcomes. For example, you might have the computer generate a random value and use it to adjust color variables to represent different eye colors in the world (based on the percentage of each among the people of the world).

## Example: Data Visualization

This example is not runnable, but shows another example of "else-if". In the following data visualization, the blue circle at each National Park increases in size depending on the number of visitors to the park.

![A map of the United States, showing a blue circle over each National Park; the popular parks have larger circles than the less popular ones](64725821)

The programmer could use the number of visitors and a mathematical operation to calculate the radius of each circle, but they could also use "else-if" statements to set the radius like this:

```java
// *** this code example is not runnable ***
// This code assumes each location would have data indicating
// the number of visitors as well as a unique x,y coordinate.
// The code below would reside in a loop that processes each location.

int radius = 5;

if (numVisitors > 100000000)
{
	radius = 50;
}
else if (numVisitors > 1000000)
{
	radius = 40;
}
else if (numVisitors > 10000)
{
	radius = 30;
}
else if (numVisitors > 1000)
{
	radius = 15;
}
else 
{
	radius = 5;
}

circle(x, y, radius);
```

## Errors

As I mentioned earlier, "else-if" statements can quickly get complex and tricky. Here are some common mistakes:

* Presenting the Boolean expressions in the wrong order so that the computer always takes the first path.
* Not including a dangling `else` branch at the end (without an `if`) to ensure the computer executes at least one path.
* Placing curly braces in the wrong place such that it changes the logical flow of the program.
* Assuming that the following code uses the same logic as the "else-if’s" described above (in this example, the computer will only execute the code in the “nested” `if` statement if the surrounding statement is also `true`; to make three paths, move the “nested” statement to the `else` section):

```java
if (/*boolean expression is true*/)
{
    if (/*a different boolean expression is true*/)
    {
    // do something
    }
    else
    {
    // do a different something 
    }
}
else
{
   // do yet another different something
}
```

* Assuming that the following code uses the same logic as the "else-if’s" described above (in this example, all of the statements might execute. If they were “else-if” statements, the computer would only execute the first statement with a `true` condition):

```java
if (/*boolean expression is true*/)
{
    // do something
}

if (/*a different boolean expression is true*/)
{
    // do a different something
}

// do another thing
```
