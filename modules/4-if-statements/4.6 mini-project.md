# Module 4 Mini-Project

In this mini-project, you'll practice writing and debugging "if" statements as you create some *non-deterministic* visual art--art that displays differently each time you run your program. "If" statements allow us to have the computer make decisions based on the value of variables in a program. In this case, you'll write "if" statements that direct the computer to do different things based on the value of a random number.

**Copy the program below into your Processing environment. Then, write an "if" statement that changes the color of the `background()` based on the location of the "sun" in the "sky".**

```java
float sunY = random(0, 600);
int green = color(30, 200, 95);

// Hint: add your "if" statement here:
int skyColor = color(80, 200, 255); // blue, for now

// Draw the sky
background(skyColor);

// Draw the ground
noStroke();
fill(green);
rect(0, 400, 800, 200);
```

Once you've finished adding the "if" statement described above, you should consider adding some more features to the program to continue practicing "if" statements. Here are some suggestions:

* Make a loop that draws foliage. Use a random number to determine the height of the foliage--if it's above a certain height, make the foliage look like a tree. If it's below a certain height, make it look like a bush.
* Add birds in random locations--if they are low enough to appear as if they are on the "ground", draw them standing. If they are above the "ground", draw them flying.
* Use another random number to determine if the program should show a nighttime or a daytime scene; change the sun to a moon and the color of the sky accordingly

Be sure to use comments and descriptive variable names to help label the different parts of your program!

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

| Criteria  | Advanced | Proficient | Developing |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Methods   | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program makes use of a few methods, but it is unclear that you are comfortable using a variety of methods with different parameters in your programs |
| "If" Statements | Your program uses several "if" statements, including nested "if" statements, to produce complex generative art | Your program makes use of "if" statements to create non-deterministic behavior in your program | Your program uses "if" statements, but they don't affect the results of the program or don't lead to non-deterministic behavior |
| Expressiveness  | Your program uses comments and variable names that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it | Your program either does not include any comments, or the comments sometimes fail to accurately describe the code; variable names are arbitrary or misleadingly named |
