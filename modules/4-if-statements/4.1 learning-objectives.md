# Module 3 Introduction

Loops are a powerful way of scaling up your code using conditional control structures. Java supports another kind of conditional control structure: the `if` statement. "If" statements allow you to have the computer make decisions based on variable values in your program, making it possible to write simple sets of instructions which give rise to complex behavior on the part of the computer. This module is all about how to read, test, debug, and write programs that include "if" statements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Identify situations that call for conditional control structures
* Identify "if" statements and predict their execution in simple Java programs
* Predict the output of Java programs that use conditional statements
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use conditional control structures
* Predict the result of Boolean expressions that include variables as operands

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| conditional | definition |
| "if" statement | definition |
| Boolean expression | definition |
| Boolean operator | definition |
