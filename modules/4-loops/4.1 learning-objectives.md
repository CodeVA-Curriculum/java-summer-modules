# Module 4 Introduction

"If" statements are a powerful way of automating decision-making using conditional control structures. Java supports another kind of conditional control structure: the `while` loop. Loops allow you to *scale* your code, making it possible to write simple sets of instructions which give rise to complex behavior on the part of the computer. This module is all about how to read, test, debug, and write programs that include loops.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Identify situations that call for conditional loops
* Identify `while` loops and predict their execution in simple Java programs
* Predict the output of Java programs that use loops
* Identify and fix programs that contain infinite loops
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use `while` loops

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `while` loop | definition |
| iteration | definition |
| increment | definition |
