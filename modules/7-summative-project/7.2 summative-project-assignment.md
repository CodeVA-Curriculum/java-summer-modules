# Summative Project Instructions

Congratulations on finishing the CodeVA Java pre-work modules! Your final step in preparing for our summer training is to complete a summative coding project, one that demonstrates your learning and new coding knowledge.

**Create a Processing program that addresses the following prompt:**

> Create an interactive Processing program inspired by something from the natural world.

You have a choice as to how to complete this project. You can either:

1. Get started right now, creating something wholly original using example code from previous modules as a guide.

2. Follow the optional *Project Walkthrough* included in this module, which shows you one way to complete the prompt using step-by-step instructions and code examples.

Here are some ideas of specific projects that address the prompt that you could make, if you want:

>Create a bird whose eyes follow the mouse. When the user clicks the mouse, show a speech bubble with a music note in it for a couple of seconds.

> Create a garden with flowers that sway in the wind. When the user clicks on a flower, have a bee land on it and then fly away.

>Create a dark cloud and a rainstorm that follows the player's mouse. When the user clicks the mouse, show a lightning bolt for a split second.

The project walkthrough will show you how to make a program like this:

![A screen recording of a Processing program in which the user clicks and holds the mouse to draw trees on a landscape](TODO:)

Either strategy is fine. If you are still feeling a little uncomfortable with coding and Processing, you can follow the walkthrough to learn more about how to design programs in Processing. That said, the example program is pretty complicated, and you could easily make a simpler original program instead. If you want an extra challenge, you can try to make a copy of the example program based on the GIF above *without* looking at the walkthrough tutorial! It's up to you how you engage with this final coding project.

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

| Criteria  | Goal | Stretch Goal |
| --------- | ---- | ------------ |
| Methods   | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials |
| Variables | Your program initializes and uses several variables, and modifies the values of those variables using arithmetic expressions | Your program initializes, invokes, and modifies variables of several different types throughout the program using arithmetic expressions as appropriate |
| Control Stuctures | Your program makes use of control stuctures to create non-deterministic behavior in your program | Your program uses several control structures across many different parts of your program (including in the animation loop, custom methods, and input methods) to create an interactive Processing program |
| Interactivity | Your program is interactive, making use of at least two of the interactivity strategies available in the Processing API | Your program makes use of several interactivity strategies built into Processing, including reacting to mouse clicks, keystrokes, and the mouse location in the application window |
| Custom Methods | Your program makes use of one or more custom methods to display composite figures (i.e., visual elements made up of more than one primitive shape) | Your program makes use of several custom methods, each with a particularly elegant functional component purpose in the design of your program |
| Expressiveness | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it | Your program uses comments and variable names that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code |
