# Module 7 Introduction

In this module, you'll complete a summative Processing project where you use the code patterns, strategies, and concepts you've learned from the previous modules to create an original interactive program using Java and Processing. You should plan on spending between 1 and 2 hours completing the project.

## Learning Objectives

 The goal of the project is for you to demonstrate the following skills, knowledge, and competencies:

 * Create, initialize, update, and make use of variables in parameters, arithmetic expressions, "if" statements, and/or "while" loops.
 * Write, test, and debug Boolean expressions as a part of "while" loops and "if" statements
 * Write, test, and debug control structures, specifically "if" statements and "while" loops
 * Create, test, and debug custom methods
 * Make use of built-in Processing methods, including shape primitives, the animation loop, and the user input methods (e.g., `mouseClicked()`), using the Processing reference materials, documentation, and previous work as a guide when needed
 * Trace the execution of a Processing Java program as you build and debug your program during development

 *Note: There is no new vocabulary for this module.*
