# Module 9 Mini-Project

This mini-project gives you the opportunity to modify existing code to add new features, and to practice creating objects and using the dot operator to call methods and create animations.

The code example below contains three tabs: a main program, a template for a Tree, and a template for a Cloud. Copy the programs into Processing and run them to see the output.

<!-- Tree_and_Cloud.PNG -->
:::code-example{src="TODO:" alt="Processing window display showing the image with a gray background with a tree (brown rectangle and green circle) and a cloud (6 overlapping white circles)." tabs}
::name[Main]
```java
// MAIN PROGRAM
Tree myTree;
Cloud myCloud;

void setup() {
  noStroke();
  size(400, 400);
  myTree = new Tree();
  myCloud = new Cloud(50, 50);
}

void draw() {
  background(200);
  myTree.display();
  myCloud.display();
}
```

::name[Tree]
```java
// Tree OBJECT BLUEPRINT
class Tree {
   int green = color(46, 179, 93);
   int brown = color(92, 81, 59);
   float x;
   float y;
   float size;

   // constructors
   Tree() {
       x = 200;
       y = 200;
       size = 100;
   }

   Tree(float tempX, float tempY, float tempSize) {
       x = tempX;
       y = tempY;
       size = tempSize;
   }

   void display() {
      fill(brown);
      rect(x, y, size / 5, size);
      fill(green);
      circle(x+10, y+10, size);
   }
}

```

::name[Cloud]
```java
// Cloud OBJECT BLUEPRINT
class Cloud {
  float x;
  float y;
  float r;

   // constructor
  Cloud(float inX, float inY) {
    x = inX;
    y = inY;
    r = 40; 
  }

  void display() {
    fill(255);
    circle(x, y, r);
    circle(x, y+20, r);
    circle(x-(r/2), y-(r/2-5), r);
    circle(x+(r/2+5), y-(r/4), r);
    circle(x-(r/2+5), y+(r/2-3), r);
    circle(x+(r/2+5), y+(r/2), r);
  }
}
```
:::

## Part 1

Modify the programs to complete both of the following tasks:

1. Create a second Tree object in main using Treeâ€™s 3-argument constructor and display your new tree. 
2. Add a 3-argument constructor to the Cloud class to set the values for `x`, `y`, and `r`. Then create a second cloud object in the main program using your new constructor. Modify the main program to display the new cloud.

## Part 2

Add a `move()` method to your Cloud class and call it from the main program on one of your cloud objects (or both). The `move()` method should perform one of the following challenges (or make up your own):

* **Mild:** Moves the cloud across the screen and off the edge
* **Medium:** Moves the cloud across the screen and off the edge, but then the cloud reappears on the left-hand side to float across again
* **Spicy:** Moves the cloud across the screen and off the edge and then reappears on the left-hand side to float across again. In addition, the circles within the cloud shift slightly, so that the cloud appears to be changing its shape as it travels across

Be sure to use comments and descriptive variable names to help label the different parts of your program!

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric [TODO: update rubric to include parameters, return values, and overloading]

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

| Criteria  | Goal | Stretch Goal |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Methods   | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials |
| Custom Methods | Your program makes use of one or more custom methods to display composite figures (i.e., visual elements made up of more than one primitive shape) | Your program makes use of several custom methods, each with a particularly elegant functional component purpose in the design of your program |
| Expressiveness | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it | Your program uses comments and variable names that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code |
