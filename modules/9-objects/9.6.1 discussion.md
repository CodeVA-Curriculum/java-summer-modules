# Module 9 Mini-Project Gallery & Discussion

Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of a program that you created for the *Module 9 Mini-Project*.

Then, in the same post, respond to the following reflective questions:

1. Object-oriented programming is a tricky topic, so teachers will often rely on metaphors to help communicate the basic principles of classes and objects. Some popular terms include “blueprint”, “cookie cutter”, and “template”. Which term would you prefer or is there another metaphor you might use that you think would be helpful?
2. Object-oriented code is different from the code you’ve written in prior modules. It takes time and practice to get more comfortable with it, and the process of writing your programs may also change. Object-oriented coding often involves planning out what classes and methods you need ahead of time rather than jumping in with variables and control structures right away. What are two of the biggest questions you have right now about object-oriented design or using objects? What topics do you imagine your students might struggle with?

We'd love to use your work as an example in future trainings; please leave a note on this discussion board post if you are okay with us using your code, images of your program output, or the text of your reflections anonymously in future trainings.
