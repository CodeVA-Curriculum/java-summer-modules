# Module 9 Introduction

In this module, youâ€™ll learn about object-oriented programming by creating and using custom objects. You can think of objects as complex data types that encapsulate attributes and behaviors associated with a particular component in your program or its output. Like methods, object-oriented programming is another mechanism to modularize a larger program. With objects you can contain related variables and methods in one location to increase readability and reusability and also make testing and debugging easier. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Write a class to define a blueprint for an object
* Create an object and use dot notation with the object
* Read, test, and debug simple Java programs that use object-oriented design

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| object | An abstract data type created by a developer. |
| constructor | A special method used to initialize a new object. |
| dot notation | Syntax used with objects to access methods. |
| class | A structure that can be used to define the blueprint for an object. |
| state | The attributes or variables associated with a particular object. |
| behavior | The actions or methods that can be used to access or modify a particular object. |
| getter | A method in object-oriented programming that is used to access the state of an object. |
| setter | A method in object-oriented programming that is used to modify the state of an object. |
