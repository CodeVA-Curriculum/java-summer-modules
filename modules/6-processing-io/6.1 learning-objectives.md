# Module 6 Introduction

So far, your Processing programs have not been interactive. They may generate an interesting visual, but the person viewing that visual cannot affect it by clicking or pressing keys on the keyboard. That said, if you've explored some [other Processing projects](https://openprocessing.org/browse/#), you have probably noticed that *many* of them are interactive. They react to mouse movements, clicks, and key presses. This module is all about how to use Processing input variables and methods to make your program interactive.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Implement Processing input methods based on documentation
* Trace the execution of a program that uses Processing input methods
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use global Processing input variables
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use Processing input methods

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:
