# Loop Practice

Let’s practice making loops for the repeated-code examples! Each example below provides decreasing levels of scaffolding similar to “I do, we do, you do” where “I do” receives the most help, “you do” receives the least and “we do” is somewhere in between. 

Open Processing and work through each example, one at a time. When learning new syntax, typing the code yourself can help internalize nuances (where symbols are placed, finding symbols on the keyboard, etc). After you get more comfortable, you can switch to copying and pasting existing loop code to reuse it.

## "I Do"

Here is some repeated code to display 10 dice rolls:

```java
// 10 dice rolls
int diceRoll = (int) random(1,7);
print("roll 1 is ");
println(diceRoll);
diceRoll = (int) random(1,7);
print("roll 2 is ");
println(diceRoll);
diceRoll = (int) random(1,7);
print("roll 3 is ");
println(diceRoll);
// etc...
```

When you think about refactoring code to use a loop instead of repeated statements, you should ask and answer the following questions:

1. What code statements are being repeated?

In this example, the repeated code looks like this:

```java
diceRoll = (int) random(1,7);
print("roll 1 is ");
println(diceRoll);
```

2. What stays the same on each iteration and what changes?
    a. The variable declaration (`int diceRoll`) only happens once
    b. The number is different in each print(`"roll 1 is "`);
    c. All other code is identical
3. What variables are being used or need to be created? 
    a. `diceRoll` holds the random value
    b. We could use a variable to represent the roll number starting at `1`
4. What is the loop control variable? Where does it start? stop?
    a. The number of rolls. It starts at 1 and stops after 10.

We need a variable to count the dice rolls and we also need a variable to display the current roll number. We can create two variables or use one variable to accomplish both tasks. Also, we have to break up the print roll statement so we can print a variable value for the roll number. 

Here's some **psuedocode** that illustrates the process:

```
create variable for dice roll
create variable for roll number starting at 1
while roll number is under 11
{
	generate random dice roll
	display roll number and dice roll
	increment (add one) to roll number
}
```

...and here's the final version, written in Java:

```java
// 10 dice rolls with while loop

// declare variables outside of the loop body and initialize if necessary
int diceRoll;		
int num = 1;		// loop control variable

while (num <= 10)		// evaluate loop control variable
{
diceRoll = (int) random(1,7);
print("roll ");
print(num);		// cleverly use loop control variable to print roll number
print(" is ");
println(diceRoll);
	num = num + 1;	// change loop control variable
}
```

## "We Do"

Here's some repeated code to display 10 trees in a row:

:::code-example{src="64725452" alt="The output of the program above, displaying ten trees rendered with simple shapes in a row, stretching from one side of the image to the other"}
```java
// colors
int blue = color(157, 227, 250); 
int green = color(46, 179, 93);
int brown = color(92, 81, 59);

// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(blue);

// tree 1
float x = 50;
float y = 300;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// tree 2
x = x + 60;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// tree 3
x = x + 60;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);
// etc…
```
:::

Here are the "loop-building questions" from before:

1. What code statements are being repeated?

In this situation, the repeated code looks like this:

```java
x = x + 60;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20 , 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);
```

2. What stays the same on each iteration and what changes?  
    a. The variable declarations for `x` and `y` happen once
    b. The initial values for `x` and `y` are given and then `x` is offset by `60` each time.
    c. All other code is identical
3. What variables are being used or need to be created?
    a. x and y hold the x and y coordinates used to draw the circle and rectangle
4. What is the loop control variable? Where does it start? stop? 
    a. The number of trees drawn. It starts at 1 and stops after 10.

We need a variable to count the trees and control the loop. We also need to consider an approach for the first tree, since it’s values are hard-coded and do not use the offset like trees 2-10 do. It is common to have to tweak code solutions to fit the repetitive nature of a loop. There are often multiple ways to structure a loop for a particular solution.

Below are descriptions of three possible solutions for the tree example (do not click the reveal buttons just yet!). Each of the approaches is a valid solution and neither one is more nor less efficient than the other, so it is a matter of choice by the person writing the code (that’s YOU!). Choose one of the approaches that makes the most sense to you and write the loop solution. Use pseudocode if you need help getting started. After you write your code, test it and then use the reveals below to compare your code to the same solution and to view the slight variations in the other solutions.

1. Draw the first tree outside the loop and use a loop to draw the next 9 trees.

:::collapse{title="Reveal Code"}
```java
// colors
int blue = color(157, 227, 250); 
int green = color(46, 179, 93);
int brown = color(92, 81, 59);

// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(blue);

// 1st tree
float x = 50;
float y = 300;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// 9 trees in a loop
int counter = 1;	// loop control variable
while (counter <= 9)
{
x = x + 60;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);
counter = counter + 1;
}
```
:::

2. Use the loop to draw all the trees, but adjust the initial value of `x` so that the first tree is drawn with an `x` value of `50`.

:::collapse{title="Reveal Code"}
```java
// colors
int blue = color(157, 227, 250); 
int green = color(46, 179, 93);
int brown = color(92, 81, 59);

// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(blue);

// 10 trees in a loop
float x = -10;
float y = 300;
int counter = 1;	// loop control variable

while (counter <= 10)
{
    x = x + 60;
    fill(brown);
    rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
    fill(green);
    circle(x, y, 100);
    counter = counter + 1;
}
```
:::

3. Use a loop to draw all the trees and keep the initial value for `x`, but reorder the statements in the loop so that the first tree is drawn with an `x` value of `50`.

:::collapse{title="Reveal Code"}
```java
// colors
int blue = color(157, 227, 250); 
int green = color(46, 179, 93);
int brown = color(92, 81, 59);

// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(blue);

// 10 trees in a loop
float x = 50;
float y = 300;
int counter = 1;	// loop control variable

while (counter <= 10)
{
    fill(brown);
    rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
    fill(green);
    circle(x, y, 100);
    counter = counter + 1;
    x = x + 60;
}
```

Can you think of other variations? After looking at all the solutions, do you have a preference?

## "You Do"

Attempt this example on your own. The repeated code and loop questions are provided below for your convenience. Plan your solution, code it in Processing, test it, and then click reveal below to see our solution. Finally, adjust the loop to generate 25, 50, or 100 trees to appreciate the power and flexibility of using a loop!

Here is the repeated code to display 10 trees in random locations:

:::code-example{src="64725453" alt="The output of the program above, displaying ten trees rendered with simple shapes in random locations around the image"}
```java
// colors
int blue = color(157, 227, 250); 
int green = color(46, 179, 93);
int brown = color(92, 81, 59);

// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(blue);

// random tree 1
float x = random(100, 540);
float y = random(100, 380);
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// random tree 2
x = random(100, 540);
y = random(100, 380);
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// random tree 3
x = random(100, 540);
y = random(100, 380);
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);
// etc…
```

* What code statements are being repeated?
* What stays the same on each iteration and what changes?  
* What variables are being used or need to be created?
* What is the loop control variable? Where does it start? stop?
