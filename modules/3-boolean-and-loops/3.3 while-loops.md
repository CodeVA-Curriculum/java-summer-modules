# "While" Loops

When you are writing programs and notice that a block of code is being repeated, you should probably consider a way to condense the code. One way is using a loop control structure. A loop control structure tells the computer to repeat a block of code multiple times. Java provides several looping patterns: `while` loops, `for` loops, and `do-while` loops. This course covers `while` loops, so don’t worry about the other two types for now.

## Examples

I've provided two "while" loop examples below that you can copy into Processing, run, and modify. Refer to these examples as you read through the specifics of while loop syntax, boolean expressions, and writing loops below.

### Example 1

This example displays “Hello, World!” 5 times at random locations on the screen.

:::code-example{src="TODO:"}
```java
size(640, 480);
int count = 1;
while (count <= 5)
{
	text(“Hello, World!”, random(0,610), random(0,479));
	count = count + 1;
}
```
:::

### Example 2

This example draws vertical lines across the screen until the the variable called `x`'s value exceeds the size of the application window.

:::code-example{src="TODO:"}
```java
size(640, 480);
int x = 5;
int y1 = 200;
int y2 = 300;
while (x <= 640)
{
	line(x, y1, x, y2);
	x = x + 25;
}
```

## "While" Loop Syntax

Here is the syntax for a while loop:

```java
while (boolean expression is true)
{
	// instruction(s) to repeat
}
```

*Boolean expression* represents a logical statement that evaluates to `true` or `false` and "instructions to repeat" are any number of Java code statements. The code inside the curly braces is commonly referred to as the "body" of the loop. Note the specific nuances in the above code blocks:

* No semicolon at the end of the "while" statement
* Parenthesis `( )` around the boolean expression
* Curly braces `{ }` around the repeated code statements
* The repeated code statements *do* end in semicolons 

## Boolean Expressions

In a "while" loop, the boolean expression determines how many times the loop executes and when the loop stops. If the boolean expression in a "while" loop evaluates to `true`, the computer executes the code in the loop body sequentially and then evaluates the boolean expression again. If the expression is still `true` after running the code in the loop body, then the computer executes the code in the loop body a second time and then evaluates the boolean expression again. The computer will keep executing the code in the loop body until the boolean expression evaluates to `false`; then, it will stop repeating and proceed with the code after the loop. On paper, you could draw an arrow like this to signify the loop process:

A boolean expression is a logical statement that uses relational operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.) to compare primitive values. The expression evaluates to `true` if the comparison is true, and `false` otherwise. You can use relational operators with any primitive data type, but our programs focus on `int` and `float`. The following table shows the syntax for boolean expressions to compare two values, `x` and `y`:

| Boolean Expression | What You Should Say in Your Head |
| `x == y` | "Is `x` equal to `y`?" |
| `x != y` | "Is `x` not equal to `y` |
| `x < y` | "Is `x` less than `y`? |
| `x <= y` | "Is `x` less than or equal to `y`? |
| `x > y` | "Is `x` greater than `y`? |
| `x >= y` | "Is `x` greater than or equal to `y`? |

In these examples, `x` and `y` represent math expressions, variable names, or literal values, for example, `val != num / 2` or, for example, `num < -3.5`, where `num` and `val` are `int` or `float` variables. Programs can compare `Strings` or other object types, but the code is more complex and is beyond the scope of this course.

## Writing "While" Loops

"While" loops follow this pattern:

```
create variable with initial value
while variable has not reached some threshold
{
	do stuff
	change variable
}
```

This pattern description uses **pseudocode** (a mixture of code syntax an written language) to lay out a design plan for code that is easy to understand and is also easy to translate into Java. Pseudocode is a great way to write steps for a solution without getting bogged down by specific code syntax.

Programmers use the term **iteration** to describe the repetition in loops. In *Example 1*, we can say “the loop iterates 5 times.” For *Example 2*, we can say, “the program directs the compute to draw a line on each iteration until it reaches the edge of the screen.”

Sometimes the programmer knows how many times a loop should iterate. The loop in *Example 1*, as written, runs exactly 5 times. Note that there are other ways to write this code, for example, we can initialize `count` to `0` and check for `count < 5`.

Other loops iterate until a certain condition is met, like reaching the edge of a screen (as in *Example 2*) or encountering the end of a file that the computer is reading into the program. The loop still executes a specific number of times, but the number of times is not pre-determined by the programmer. In *Example 2*, the programmer could’ve written the code to draw a certain number of lines drawn across the screen, but instead focuses on reaching the edge of the screen to terminate the drawing.

When designing a loop, imagine what the code would look like without a loop, written the long way. Then, consider:

* What code statements are being repeated?
* What stays the same on each iteration and what changes? 
* What variables are being used or need to be created?
* What is the loop control variable? Where does it start? stop? 

...where the term **loop control variable** refers to the variable used in the boolean expression. You might also consider outlining the steps for the loop in pseudocode.

## Common "While" Loop Errors

* Forgetting to change the loop control variable inside * The loop body resulting in an infinite loop (a loop that never stops).
* Incorrect initialization or boolean expression so the loop never runs at all or never stops.
* Off by one error - loop executes one less or one more time than desired.
* Semicolon at the end of the "while" statement resulting in an infinite loop.

## Practice

Tinker with the **Examples** to make the loops do something different. Here are two ideas:
* Change *Example 1* so the program shows `“Hello, World!”` **ten** times instead of five. Then, add code to randomize the text size for each message.
* Change *Example 2* to draw horizontal lines from the top of the screen to the bottom.
