# Module 3 Introduction

You may have noticed that your programs tend to be pretty repetitive. A lot of times, your code will involve calling the same methods over and over again, with small differences in the parameters you choose to pass. Java has a way to automate repetition in your code using a special code pattern called a *loop*. Loops allow you to have the computer repeat a set of instructions, allowing you to create complex patterns without writing lots of code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Identify situations that call for conditional loops
* Identify `while` loops and predict their execution in simple Java programs
* Predict the output of Java programs that use loops
* Identify and fix programs that contain infinite loops
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use `while` loops

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `while` loop | definition |
| iteration | definition |
| increment | definition |
