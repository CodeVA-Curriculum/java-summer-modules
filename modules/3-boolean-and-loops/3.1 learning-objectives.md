# Module 3 Introduction

You may have noticed that your programs tend to be pretty repetitive. A lot of times, your code will involve calling the same methods over and over again, with small differences in the parameters you choose to pass. Java has a way to automate repetition in your code using a special code pattern called a *loop*. Loops allow you to have the computer repeat a set of instructions, allowing you to create complex patterns without writing lots of code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Write boolean expressions that evaluate to true or false to control your loops 
* Identify situations that call for conditional loops
* Identify `while` loops and predict their execution in simple Java programs
* Predict the output of Java programs that use loops
* Identify and fix programs that contain infinite loops
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use `while` loops

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `while` loop | A program structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is `true`. |
| boolean expression | A logical statement that evaluates to `true` or `false`. |
| loop control variable | A variable in the boolean expression of a loop that determines how long the loop executes and when it stops. |
| loop body | The code that is executed/repeated in a loop. |
| iteration | A single repetition of a loop; the process of repeating. |
| infinite loop | A loop that never stops repeating on its own, usually due to to a programmer error. |
| pseudocode | A mixture of English and Java used to illustrate or explain the steps of an algorithm (code solution) |
