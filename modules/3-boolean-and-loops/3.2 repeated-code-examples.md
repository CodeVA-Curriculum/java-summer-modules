# Repeated Code Examples

Sometimes, you may find yourself needing to repeat code, like when you generated 10 random integers to simulate 10 dice rolls:

```java
// 10 dice rolls
int diceRoll = (int) random(1,7);
print("roll 1 is ");
println(diceRoll);
diceRoll = (int) random(1,7);
print("roll 2 is ");
println(diceRoll);
diceRoll = (int) random(1,7);
print("roll 3 is ");
println(diceRoll);
// etc…
```

Or, if you wanted to display 10 trees in a row, like this, you would have to write a lot of similar `rect` and `circle` method calls:

![An image of several trees in a line, drawn with Processing](TODO:seedoc)

You could start with the following code for the first tree:

```java {12-15}
// colors
int blue = color(157, 227, 250); 
int green = color(46, 179, 93);
int brown = color(92, 81, 59);

// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(blue);

// tree 1
float x = 50;
float y = 300;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);
```

...and then copy the last 4 lines and add an offset for the x value to create a 2nd tree. Then we could copy that code for subsequent trees:

```java {2}
// tree 2
x = x + 60;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// tree 3
x = x + 60;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// tree 4
x = x + 60;
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// tree 5
// etc...
```

If you wanted to display the trees randomly, like this:

![Several trees randomly distributed around a Processing application window](TODO:seedoc)

we could adjust the code to use random x and y values each time:

```java {12-13, 20-21}
// colors
int blue = color(157, 227, 250); 
int green = color(46, 179, 93);
int brown = color(92, 81, 59);

// create the window
size(640, 480);
noStroke();
background(blue);

// random tree 1
float x = random(100, 540);
float y = random(100, 380);
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// random tree 2
x = random(100, 540);
y = random(100, 380);
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// random tree 3
x = random(100, 540);
y = random(100, 380);
fill(brown);
rect(x - 10, y + 10, 20, 100);
fill(green);
circle(x, y, 100);

// random tree 4
// etc…
```

With any of these approaches, your program consists of identical (or very close to identical) code repeated over and over again. Repeating code increases the size of your program quickly and makes debugging more difficult. Your *computer* can handle the repetition, but it’s difficult for humans (including you, the author of the code!) to read code structured like this. Imagine if you wanted to make one hundred or one thousand trees! Surely there is a more efficient approach to repeat code. Indeed, this module solves this “repeated code problem” using *looping control structures*.
