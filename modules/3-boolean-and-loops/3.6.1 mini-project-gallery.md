# Module 3 Mini-Project Gallery & Discussion

Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of a program that you created for the *Module 2 Mini-Project*.

Then, in the same post, respond to the following discussion question:

Upload a picture of a movie scene, cartoon, game, or painting that could use a loop to generate a portion of the picture. Identify the image and then describe the repetition, including color or size changes and whether the repetition is uniform or random. Include any other coding considerations. Here is one example:

![Picture of Grand Army of the Republic taken from Star Wars Clone Wars movie.](TODO:seedoc)

> There are approximately 70 soldiers in even rows, so a simple offset can be used on each repetition to adjust the `x` and `y` coordinates. The images would be drawn from smaller `y` values first so that the images at larger `y` values are drawn on top of the others. As the `y` value increases, the image size increases slightly so those images appear closer and the gray color also gets darker to indicate moving further away from to the light source. 

We'd love to use your work as an example in future trainings; please leave a note on this discussion board post if you are okay with us using your code, images of your program output, or the text of your reflections anonymously in future trainings.
