# Module 3 Mini-Project

In this mini-project, you'll use loops to create Processing programs that display visual patterns, and that include randomness. This sort of visual art is called *generative* art, where the computer creates a *non-deterministic* piece of artistic work based on rules you write. Each time you run the code, the art is a little different.

**Copy the program below into your Processing environment, and change the code to replace repetitive code with a loop. Then, change the code so the program draws 10 ellipses instead of 5.**

```java
size(800, 600);
background(120);
noStroke();

// Draw a cloud
float x=random(300, 500);
float y=random(200, 400);
float r=random(50, 150);
ellipse(x, y, r, r);

x=random(300, 500);
y=random(200, 400);
r=random(50, 150);
ellipse(x, y, r, r);

x=random(300, 500);
y=random(200, 400);
r=random(50, 150);
ellipse(x, y, r, r);

x=random(300, 500);
y=random(200, 400);
r=random(50, 150);
ellipse(x, y, r, r);

x=random(300, 500);
y=random(200, 400);
r=random(50, 150);
ellipse(x, y, r, r);

x=random(300, 500);
y=random(200, 400);
r=random(50, 150);
ellipse(x, y, r, r);
```

Right now, the program repeats the same series of commands several times in a row. Use a `while` loop and an iterating variables to have the computer loop the repeated section of code, then remove the repetitive commands. The starter code above is 33 lines long; the code will be around 15 lines long when you refactor the code to use a loop rather than repeated commands (that's just an estimate, don't hold yourself to it).

Once you've refactored the example, consider adding some more non-deterministic features to the code. Here are some suggestions:

* Create a mathematical expression that allows you to make circles toward the top of the cloud a lighter color grey than the circles toward the bottom. This will create the illusion of a "shadow" on the bottom of the cloud.
* Make the cloud a random size, with a randomly determined number of circles.
* Add one or more loops to have the computer display more than one cloud.

Be sure to use comments and descriptive variable names to help label the different parts of your program!

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

| Criteria | Goal | Stretch Goal |
| -------- | ---- | ------------ |
| Methods  | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials |
| Loops | Your program makes use of a while loop that repeats a given number of times before ending its repetition | Your program uses nested loops (a while loop inside another while loop) to perform complex repetition |
| Expressiveness | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it | Your program uses comments and variable names that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code |

<!-- | Criteria  | Advanced | Proficient | Developing |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Methods   | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program makes use of a few methods, but it is unclear that you are comfortable using a variety of methods with different parameters in your programs |
| Loop | Your program uses nested loops (a `while` loop inside another `while` loop) to perform complex repetition | Your program makes use of a `while` loop that repeats a given number of times before ending its repetition | Your program includes a `while` loop, but may fail to end the repetition resulting in an infinitely looping program that never stops |
| Expressiveness  | Your program uses comments and variable names that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it | Your program either does not include any comments, or the comments sometimes fail to accurately describe the code; variable names are arbitrary or misleadingly named | -->
