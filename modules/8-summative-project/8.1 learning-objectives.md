# Summative Project Introduction

Congratulations on finishing the CodeVA Java pre-work modules! Your final step in preparing for our summer training is to complete a summative coding project, one that demonstrates your learning and new coding knowledge.

**Create a Processing program that addresses the following prompt:**

> Create an interactive Processing program inspired by something from the natural world.

You have a choice as to how to complete this project. You can either:

1. Get started right now, creating something wholly original using example code from previous modules as a guide.

2. Follow the optional *Project Walkthrough* included in this module, which shows you one way to complete the prompt using step-by-step instructions and code examples.

Here are some ideas of specific projects that address the prompt that you could make, if you want:

>Create a bird whose eyes follow the mouse. When the user clicks the mouse, show a speech bubble with a music note in it for a couple of seconds.

> Create a garden with flowers that sway in the wind. When the user clicks on a flower, have a bee land on it and then fly away.

>Create a dark cloud and a rainstorm that follows the player's mouse. When the user clicks the mouse, show a lightning bolt for a split second.

The project walkthrough will show you how to make a program like this:

Either strategy is fine. If you are still feeling a little uncomfortable with coding and Processing, you can follow the walkthrough to learn more about how to design programs in Processing. That said, the example program is pretty complicated, and you could easily make a simpler original program instead. If you want an extra challenge, you can try to make a copy of the example program based on the GIF above *without* looking at the walkthrough tutorial! It's up to you how you engage with this final coding project.
