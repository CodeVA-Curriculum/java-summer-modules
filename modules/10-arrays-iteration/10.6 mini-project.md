# Module 10 Mini-Project

The following `RainDrop` class is an object template for a single drop of rain. The drop is generated at a random location, with a random length, and a random falling speed. 

```java
// Object template for one drop of rain. 
// Code taken and modified from Daniel Shiffman’s Purple Rain Example
class RainDrop {
  float x;
  float y;
  float yspeed;
  float len;
  
  RainDrop() {
    x = random(400);
    y = random(-500,-100);
    yspeed = random(4,10);
    len = random(5,15);
  }

  void show() {
    fall();
    fill(172,211,215);
    line(x, y, x, y+len);
  }
    
  void fall() {
    y = y + yspeed;
    
    if (y > 400) {
      y = random(-500,-100);
    }
  }
  
}
```

Write a main program from scratch (you can copy other existing code to get started) that displays an array of `RainDrop` objects. Test your program and then add an additional feature. Create your own or use one of the ideas below:

* **Mild:** Add a new array of objects in the background
* **Medium:** Add a new array of objects and provide the capability to add more objects by clicking the mouse (with `append()`)
* **Spicy:** Alter the rain in some way (speed it up, make the drops bigger, or change the color) whenever the mouse is clicked.

You can use and modify any existing object templates that you’ve created so far, or create a brand new one. Be sure to use comments and descriptive variable names to help label the different parts of your program!

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

| Criteria  | Goal | Stretch Goal |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Arrays   | Your program correctly initializes an array and accesses elements within it | Your program uses loops to traverse one or more arrays |
| Objects | Your program correctly constructs objects within an array, and calls methods on those objects | Your program includes new methods with parameters and/or return values, and calls those methods on objects stored within arrays |
| Expressiveness | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it | Your program uses comments and variable names that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code |
