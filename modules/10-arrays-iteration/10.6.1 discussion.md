# Module 10 Mini-Project Gallery & Discussion

Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of a program that you created for the *Module 10 Mini-Project*.

Then, in the same post, respond to the following reflective questions:

1. Arrays increase data storage in your programs, but requires learning new syntax. What are some ways that debugging your program and verifying its logic is easier when using arrays? What are some ways that it is more difficult?
2. When compiling and running your programs, what error(s) did you encounter most frequently (IndexOutOfBounds, NullPointer, syntax, logic, etc.)? What strategies did you use to locate your errors and correct them?

> We'd love to use your work as an example in future trainings; please leave a note on this discussion board post if you are okay with us using your code, images of your program output, or the text of your reflections anonymously in future trainings.
