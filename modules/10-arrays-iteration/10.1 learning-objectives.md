# Module 10 Introduction

In prior modules, we used variables to store values, where each variable holds one value at a time. The one value may be an object that has a set of variables associated with itâ€”for example, a `Tree` that has a size and `x` and `y` coordinates, but the object variable itself only holds the value of one `Tree` object at a time. Creating complex programs with more realistic designs and animations, though, often requires the ability to manage hundreds or even thousands of variables. Arrays (also called lists) use one variable to store multiple values with the same data type. In other words, one single array variable can hold hundreds or even thousands of `Tree` objects. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Write code to create and initialize an array of objects
* Write code to access the elements in the array using an index for the array
* Write code to traverse the array using a loop and an index to access each element in the array


## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| array | A storage container to hold a list or collection of items with the same data type. |
| element | A single item in an array. |
| index | A number to identify a single item in an array. Index values are integers that begin at 0 and end at the length of the array minus one. For example, an array of size 10 has index values from 0 to 9. |
| traverse | To travel through or, with an array, to visit each element in the array, one by one. |
