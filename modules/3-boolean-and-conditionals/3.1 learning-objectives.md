# Module 3 Introduction

Storing information is powerful, but one of the most common use cases for a computational system is to automate decision-making. To have computers make decisions, programmers need to write code that expresses a choice, and have the computer determine what choice to make under various conditions. In this module, you'll learn about how to have computers make decisions using *conditional* control structures.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Identify situations that call for conditional control structures
* Identify "if" statements and predict their execution in simple Java programs
* Predict the output of Java programs that use conditional statements
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that use conditional control structures
* Predict the result of Boolean expressions that include variables as operands

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| control structure | definition |
| conditional | definition |
| Boolean expression | definition |
| Boolean operator | definition |
