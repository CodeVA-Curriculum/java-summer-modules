# Module 5 Introduction

So far, you've used Processing to create static images. If you've explored some [other Processing programs](https://openprocessing.org/browse/#), however, you may have noticed that pretty much all of them involve some kind of *animation* and *user interaction*, where shapes move around on the screen and the user can control what happens in the program using the mouse or keyboard. This module is about setting up your Processing program so that you can update the image it produces over time, rather than just creating a single image. Then, you'll learn how to have your program react to user input via the mouse and keyboard.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

* Describe the execution of Processing programs that include `setup()` and `draw()`, `keyPressed()`, and `mouseClicked()` method declarations
* Trace the values of variables in a looping Processing program
* Identify "global" or "local" variables, and trace their values
* Read, test, debug, and write simple Java programs that contain simple animations and user input

## Vocabulary

Throughout this module, you'll learn about the following topics and coding skills:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| method declaration | definition |
| global | definition |
| local | definition |
