# Module 5 Mini-Project

In this project, you'll create an *interactive* Processing program that allows the user to control visual elements using their mouse and/or keyboard. Most software programs are interactive in some way, and integrating some ways for the user to control the visuals can lead to very interesting results. People use these interactivity strategies to make games, tools, and all kinds of other interesting types of software with Processing.

**Copy the code below into your Processing environment, which causes the computer to draw lots of trees one at a time in random locations. Modify the code so the programs draws an oak tree (a tree with a circle for "leaves") when the user clicks the mouse, and a pine tree (a tree with a triangle for "leaves") when the user presses a key on the keyboard.**

```java
int green  = color(30, 200, 95);
int brown = color(116, 83, 83);
int sky = color(80, 200, 255);

void setup() {
  size(800, 600);
  background(sky);
}

void draw() {
  noStroke();
  
  // draw a tree
  float x = random(0, 800);
  float y = random(0, 600);
  
  fill(brown);
  rect(x-10, y, 20, 100);
  fill(green);
  circle(x, y, 120);
}
```

> If you'd like an additional challenge, try adding some of the features below:
>
> * Making it so the tree appears near the user's mouse pointer when they click instead of at a random location.
> * Make the trees that appear on screen random sizes
> * Draw several randomly generated clouds during the `setup()` method

Be sure to use comments and descriptive variable names to help label the different parts of your program!

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

| Criteria  | Goal | Stretch Goal |
| --------- | ---- | ------------ |
| Methods   | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials |
| Interactivity | Your program is interactive, making use of at least two of the interactivity strategies available in the Processing API | Your program makes use of several interactivity strategies built into Processing, including reacting to mouse clicks, keystrokes, and the mouse location in the application window |
| Expressiveness | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it and/or running it | Your program uses comments, spacing, and variable names that accurately describe and emphasize the purpose of each section of code |
