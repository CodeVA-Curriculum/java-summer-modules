# Module 5 Mini-Project

In this mini-project, you'll use Processing's built-in animation loop (i.e., the `setup()` and `draw()` methods) to create a piece of animated visual art. Using Processing's built-in `setup()` and `draw()` methods can be tricky, but using them opens up some powerful possibilities for your coding work. Almost all of the Processing projects you can check out [here](https://openprocessing.org/browse/#) use the standard `setup()` and `draw()` methods; it's definitely worth figuring out!

**Copy the code below into your Processing environment, which displays an elliptical cloud floating across the screen. Then, make the following additions:**

1. Write an "if" statement that resets the `offset` variable back to `-200` when the `offset` variable causes the ellipse to be drawn past the right edge of the screen.
2. Create 3 more clouds that float alongside the first ellipse, using the same `offset` variable to set their positions.

```java
int sky = color(75, 120, 255);

// set the starting location of the cloud
float x1 = 0;
float y1 = random(0, 600);

float offset = -200; // set the starting offset value

void setup() {
  size(800, 600);
}

void draw() {
  background(sky);
  
  // move the cloud
  offset=offset+1;
  
  // draw the cloud
  ellipse(x1+offset, y1, 125, 50);
}
```

Be sure to use comments and descriptive variable names to help label the different parts of your program!

## Submission Instructions

When you've completed your program, use the text entry on this page to submit the following information (in this order, if you can):

1. A screenshot of your program's output
2. Your code (just copy and paste it into the text entry area)

## Rubric

Here's a rubric for you to use as you self-assess your work:

| Criteria  | Advanced | Proficient | Developing |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Methods   | Your program uses methods not covered in the module, indicating advanced use of the Processing reference materials | Your program makes use of a variety of methods, including repeated methods with different parameters | Your program makes use of a few methods, but it is unclear that you are comfortable using a variety of methods with different parameters in your programs |
| Processing Structure | Your program demonstrates a full grasp of Processing's execution loop | Your program uses the `setup()` and `draw()` methods to create an animated picture | Your program demonstrates a misunderstanding about Processing's execution loop (i.e., `setup()` runs once at the beginning of the program, `draw()` runs repeatedly afterward until you close the window) |
| Expressiveness  | Your program uses comments and variable names that accurately describe the purpose of each section of code | Your program uses comments to describe some sections of code and uses descriptive variable names, but it is difficult to discern the program's functionality without tracing it | Your program either does not include any comments, or the comments sometimes fail to accurately describe the code; variable names are arbitrary or misleadingly named |
