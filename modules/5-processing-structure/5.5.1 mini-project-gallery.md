# Module 5 Mini-Project Gallery & Discussion

Respond to this discussion board with a screenshot of a program that you created for the *Module 3 Mini-Project*.

Then, in the same post, respond to the following reflective question:

1. Now that you've learned about the animation loop and the input event methods built into the Processing environment, you've learned a lot of what Processing is capable of as a coding framework. What sorts of projects do you imagine an advanced student might create?

We'd love to use your work as an example in future trainings; please leave a note on this discussion board post if you are okay with us using your code, images of your program output, or the text of your reflections anonymously in future trainings.
