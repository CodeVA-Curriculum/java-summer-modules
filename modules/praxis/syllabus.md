# CodeVA Praxis Pilot Professional Learning

Welcome to the CodeVA Praxis Pilot professional learning course! This course is designed to help you build the skills and knowledge needed to pass the Computer Science Praxis exam and obtain a computer science endorsement on your Virginia teaching license. Throughout the course, you'll learn about computing systems, networks, binary, data & analysis, impacts of computing, programming, algorithms & computational thinking, and many other topics. By the end, you'll be prepared to take the Praxis exam and continue on your CS education professional journey!

Participants may include: 6-12th grade computer science, career & technical education, or math teachers, instructional technology staff, CS or educational technology specialists (LMS, Gifted, SPED, ELL, STEM, etc.), school or district-level curriculum writers, or other instructional leaders at the building or district level, or anyone who wants to add a CS endorsement to their teaching license!

**Pathways & Prerequisites:** This course has no prerequisites. This course was created to help educators are beginners with teaching CS, and covers the basics in a beginner-friendly way.

**Course Materials:** In order to participate in this course, participants must have access to 1) a computer on which they have permission to install the Processing IDE prior to the summer sessions, and 2) persistent and reliable internet access during the 3-day synchronous sessions.

## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, participants will be:

* Able to read, write, test, and debug programs written in the Java Processing framework and in the Praxis pseudocode language
* Conversant in topics related to computing systems & networks
* Perform basic data analysis tasks & weigh the challenges & affordances of different data storage paradigms
* Able to use and design algorithms to solve computational problems
* Conversant in the positive and negative effects of computing on human communities
* Explain the fundamental attributes of object-oriented & strongly-typed coding languages

## Course Agenda

The Praxis exam covers a wide range of topics, and we have found that CS teachers seeking endorsement often begin the process with a wide range of prior skills and knowledge. To accommodate this diversity of background knowledge and experience, we have created several **synchronous** and **asynchronous** modules for you to use as you design a learning sequence that fits your needs. Depending on your prior knowledge, your schedule, and your plans for teaching after endorsement, you may choose to complete different sets of modules.

### Suggested Sequences

To help you with this "a la carte" professional learning format, we've created two "suggested sequences" for you to complete--one designed for novice CS teachers with little prior CS experience, and one for more experienced teachers who just need to shore up their skills to prepare for the practice exam. Check out the tables below to see the suggested content for teachers on either end of this spectrum along with recommended due dates to keep you on-pace to complete the course. These are, of course, just suggested sequences. You can complete these modules at a faster or slower pace if you need.

### Asynchronous Sessions

The asynchronous pre-work is comprised of several Canvas modules available [here](https://virtualvirginia.instructure.com/courses/13220/) which cover the basics of coding and preparing for the Praxis exam. Participants must register for the professional learning course, and then enroll themselves in the Canvas course via [this link](https://virginialearning.catalog.instructure.com/courses/praxis-test-prep-pilot---summer-2022). Each module should take ~2-3 hours to complete, but the time required may vary from person to person.

You should consider the asynchronous modules to be *optional*; if you are already familiar with the content of the module, you should not feel obligated to complete it. However, in your role as a pilot participant, we would like you to at least read each module and respond to the pilot discussion board at the end of each module (these course elements will be clearly indicated in Canvas).

<!-- The table below lists the asynchronous modules, along with suggested due dates to correspond with the dates of related synchronous sessions.

| Module Title | Suggested Due Date |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Binary       | 6/11/2022 |
| Variables & Operators | 7/2/2022 |
| String Operations | N/A |
| Randomization & Conditionals | 7/9/2022 |
| Arrays & Iteration | 9/30/2022 |
| Search & Sort | 8/6/2022 |
| Procedures | 9/10/2022 |
| Recursion | N/A |
| Object-Oriented Programming | 10/8/2022 | -->

### Synchronous Sessions

The *Praxis Pilot* course also consists of several synchronous sessions, each focusing on providing interactive professional learning experiences for course participants. Participants should expect to engage in hands-on coding, learning, and writing with their cohort of fellow teachers as they learn the topics & skills that will appear on the CS Praxis exam.

Each synchronous session consists of:

* About 1 hour of asynchronous pre-work on Canvas
* A synchronous virtual session over Zoom
* About 45 minutes of asynchronous post-work on Canvas

Much like the asynchronous sessions, the time required to complete the asynchronous pre- and post- work may vary.

Some synchronous sessions have **suggested prerequisites**, which we recommmend you complete ahead of the session pre-work.

The table below shows the dates and times for the synchronous sessions, as well as any suggested prerequisite modules:

| Session Title | Date | Time | Suggested Prerequisite(s) |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | ------------------------- |
| Kick-Off Session | 5/28/2022 | 12-1pm | None |
| Networks & the Internet | 6/18/2022 | 12-2pm | Binary & Hexadecimal |
| Debugging & Documentation | 7/16/2022 | 12-2pm | Variables & Operators, Randomization & Conditionals (Psuedocode) *OR* Variables & Math, Loops, "If" Statements (Processing) |
| Data & Analysis | 8/13/2022 | 12-2pm | Arrays & Iteration (Psuedocode *OR* Processing), Search & Sort |
| Event-Driven Programming | 9/17/2022 | 12-2pm | Procedures (Psuedocode) *OR* Custom Methods, Methods w/ Return & Parameters (Processing) |
| Programming Concepts | 10/15/2022 | 12-2pm | Object-Oriented Programming (Pseudocode *OR* Processing) |
| Impacts of Computing | 11/19/2022 | 12-2pm | None |
| Study Session | 12/10/2022 | 10am-2pm | None |

## Getting Support

CodeVA believes that the best professional learning experiences facilitate dialogue among facilitators and participants, allowing facilitators to meet participants' individualized needs. Throughout the *Programming Using Java* professional learning experience, participants will have access to knowledgable CodeVA facilitators who will provide generalized and individualized support to ensure every participants has a positive experience while engaging with the course. Many CodeVA facilitators are experienced, full-time computer science educators teaching in Virginia, and each one has a wealth of knowledge to offer to participants.

**Getting Support for the Asynchronous Modules:** A CodeVA facilitator monitors & engages with participants in the asynchronous Canvas course up until the start of the summer sessions. They read discussion boards, assess projects and quiz results, and engage participants' questions and concerns on the course "Support" discussion board. If you have a question or you need additional support to complete the pre-work, please reach out to your course facilitator via direct message on Canvas and they will work with you to address your learning needs.

**Getting Support During the Synchronous Sessions:** CodeVA summer professional learning sessions are interactive and responsive to participants' goals and needs. You will have ample opportunity during the professional learning sessions to ask for help or additional support, especially during the afternoon hands-on collaborative portion of the session. Your facilitator is also more than willing to provide individualized support outside of the training session; don't hesitate to reach out via direct message or email if you need additional support to be successful during the summer sessions.

## Communication Norms

Please keep the following guidelines in mind as you engage with CodeVA facilitators and participants in this course:

* Always be constructive, kind, and supportive in your comments on this discussion board. If you need CodeVA to ameliorate an issue, please reach out to a facilitator via email.
* Do not post private information on this discussion board--all posts and replies are public, and while we will do our best to remove sensitive information promptly, you are responsible for sharing appropriate information in this space. If you need to communicate with CodeVA in a private, secure way, please reach out to a facilitator via email or Canvas direct message.
* Any racist, misogynistic, ableist, transphobic, or other hostile messages will be promptly removed from the discussion board. Posting these kinds of messages is grounds for removal from the Praxis Pilot course.

If at any point you need to reach out to someone from CodeVA to discuss the course or get additional support beyond what is detailed above, please email **jonstapleton@codevirginia.org** and we will help you out! You can also make use of the [General Discussion board](https://virtualvirginia.instructure.com/courses/13220/discussion_topics/321902?module_item_id=3947660) if you have questions about the course or the Praxis exam that you think others would benefit from.
