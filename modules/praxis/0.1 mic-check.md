# Mic Check!

This discussion board is a way for us to make sure that everyone has successfully enrolled in the Praxis Pilot Canvas course, and that everyone can navigate the course to find the different elements they need to interact with throughout the professional learning course.

## Instructions

Sound off in the discussion board! Create a post with the following information:

1. Where do you teach?
2. What kind of CS teaching do you do?
3. What kind of CS teaching do hope to do in the future after obtaining an endorsement?

(You've already answered these sorts of questions in the icebreaker section of the kick-off, so feel free to re-use your answers)
