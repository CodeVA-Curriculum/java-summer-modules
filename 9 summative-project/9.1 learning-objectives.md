# Java Summative Project

In this module, you'll modify coding examples to create an interactive program like this:

After we build the main program together, you can make modifications to make the project your own. By the end of the module, you will have:

* Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet
* Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet
